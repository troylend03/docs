# Changing Your Email Address

Need to update your email? You can change the email address associated with your Rallies account anytime. Your new email will need to be verified before the change is complete.

## Before You Change Your Email

**Things to know:**

- You'll need access to both your current email (to confirm the change) and your new email (to verify it)
- All Rallies communications will go to your new email after verification
- If you signed up with Google or Apple, see the special instructions below
- Your login credentials will change to use your new email

## Change Email on Web

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai) and sign in

2. Click your **profile icon** in the top right corner

3. Select **"Settings"**

4. Click the **"Account"** tab

5. Find the **Email** field and click **"Change"** or **"Edit"**

6. Enter your **new email address**

7. Enter your **current password** to confirm it's you

8. Click **"Save"** or **"Update Email"**

9. **Check your new email inbox** for a verification link

10. Click the **verification link** to confirm your new email

11. Done! Your email is now updated.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Your email change isn't complete until you click the verification link. Until then, your old email remains active.

## Change Email on Mobile

### iOS

1. Open the Rallies app
2. Tap your **profile icon** or **menu** (☰)
3. Tap **"Settings"**
4. Tap **"Account"**
5. Tap your email address
6. Enter your new email and current password
7. Tap **"Save"**
8. Verify via the link sent to your new email

### Android

1. Open the Rallies app
2. Tap the **menu icon** (☰)
3. Tap **"Settings"** → **"Account"**
4. Tap your email address
5. Enter your new email and current password
6. Tap **"Update"**
7. Verify via the link sent to your new email

## If You Signed Up with Google or Apple

### Google Sign-In Users

If you signed up using "Continue with Google," your Rallies account is linked to your Google account's email. To change it:

**Option 1:** Add a password to your Rallies account, then change the email
1. Go to Settings → Account → Password
2. Create a Rallies password
3. Now you can change your email using the steps above
4. After changing, you'll sign in with email/password (not Google)

**Option 2:** Change the email on your Google account
- Changing your Google account email will update it in Rallies automatically
- This affects all services linked to your Google account

### Apple Sign-In Users

If you used "Continue with Apple":

**If you shared your email:** Follow the standard email change process above.

**If you used "Hide My Email":** Your account uses an Apple relay address. To use a different email:
1. Go to Settings → Account and add a password
2. Then update your email using the steps above
3. You'll now sign in with email/password instead of Apple

## Verification Issues

### Didn't receive the verification email?

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Wait 5-10 minutes—delivery can be delayed
3. Make sure you entered the new email correctly
4. Try requesting a new verification email from Settings

### Verification link expired?

Links expire after 24 hours. Go back to Settings → Account and request a new verification email.

### Changed your mind?

If you haven't verified the new email yet, your old email is still active. Just ignore the verification email, and no change will occur.

## After Changing Your Email

Once your new email is verified:

- **Sign-in changes:** Use your new email to log in
- **Communications move:** All Rallies emails (alerts, receipts, updates) go to your new address
- **Password stays the same:** Your password doesn't change unless you change it separately
- **Data unchanged:** Your watchlists, portfolios, and settings remain exactly as they were

## Troubleshooting

### "Email already in use"

This email is already registered to another Rallies account. You'll need to either:
- Use a different email
- Delete the other account first (if it's yours)
- [Contact support](/support/contact) if you need help merging accounts

### "Invalid email format"

Make sure your email:
- Contains an @ symbol
- Has a valid domain (like gmail.com)
- Has no extra spaces

### "Incorrect password"

You need to enter your current Rallies password to change your email. If you forgot it:
1. [Reset your password](/account/reset-password) first
2. Then change your email

### Can't access your old email anymore?

If you no longer have access to your current account email:
1. [Contact support](/support/contact)
2. Provide information to verify your identity
3. We can help update your email manually

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will changing my email affect my subscription?

No. Your Pro subscription and billing remain unchanged. Receipts will go to your new email going forward.

### Can I change back to my old email later?

Yes, as long as you still have access to that email and it's not being used by another account.

### What if I want to use an email that's on another account I own?

You'll need to either delete the other account first or change that account's email to something else. Each email can only be associated with one account.

### Does the email change affect my connected brokerages?

No. Your brokerage connections are tied to your Rallies account, not your email address.
