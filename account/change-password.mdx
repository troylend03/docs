# Changing Your Password

Want to update your password for security or just prefer a new one? You can change it anytime from your account settings. This guide is for users who know their current password. If you forgot your password, see [Resetting a Forgotten Password](/account/reset-password) instead.

## Change Password on Web

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai) and sign in

2. Click your **profile icon** in the top right corner

3. Select **"Settings"**

4. Click the **"Account"** or **"Security"** tab

5. Find **Password** and click **"Change"**

6. Enter your **current password**

7. Enter your **new password**
   - Must be at least 8 characters
   - We recommend mixing letters, numbers, and symbols

8. Enter your new password again to **confirm**

9. Click **"Save"** or **"Update Password"**

You'll see a confirmation message, and your password is now changed.

## Change Password on Mobile

### iOS

1. Open the Rallies app
2. Tap your **profile icon** or **menu** (☰)
3. Tap **"Settings"**
4. Tap **"Account"** or **"Security"**
5. Tap **"Change Password"**
6. Enter current password, then new password twice
7. Tap **"Save"**

### Android

1. Open the Rallies app
2. Tap the **menu icon** (☰)
3. Tap **"Settings"** → **"Account"**
4. Tap **"Change Password"**
5. Enter current password, then new password twice
6. Tap **"Update"**

## Password Requirements

Your password must:
- Be at least 8 characters long

For better security, we recommend:
- Using 12+ characters
- Including uppercase and lowercase letters
- Adding numbers and symbols (!@#$%^&*)
- Not using common words or personal info (birthday, name)
- Not reusing passwords from other sites

> 💡 **Tip:** Use a password manager like 1Password, Bitwarden, or your browser's built-in manager to generate and store strong passwords.

## If You Use Google or Apple Sign-In

If you signed up using "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Apple," you may not have a Rallies password.

### To add a password:

1. Go to **Settings → Account**
2. Look for **"Add Password"** or **"Create Password"**
3. Create a password

This lets you sign in with either your social account OR your email/password.

### To change your Google/Apple password:

Your Google or Apple password is managed by Google/Apple, not Rallies:
- **Google:** [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
- **Apple:** Settings → [Your Name] → Sign-In & Security

## After Changing Your Password

Once you've changed your password:

- **You'll stay signed in** on the device where you made the change
- **Other sessions may be signed out** for security
- **Sign in with your new password** on other devices
- **Update saved passwords** in your browser or password manager

## When to Change Your Password

Consider changing your password if:

- **It's been a while** — Good practice to update periodically
- **You used it elsewhere** — And that site had a data breach
- **You shared it** — Even temporarily with someone
- **You signed in on a public computer** — Airport, library, etc.
- **You notice suspicious activity** — Unexpected changes or alerts
- **Your password is weak** — Upgrade to something stronger

## Troubleshooting

### "Incorrect current password"

The password you entered as your "current password" doesn't match. Try again carefully, or if you truly forgot it, use [password reset](/account/reset-password) instead.

### "Password doesn't meet requirements"

Make sure your new password is at least 8 characters long. If you're copying from a password manager, make sure no extra spaces were included.

### "New passwords don't match"

The "new password" and "confirm password" fields must be exactly identical. Try typing more slowly or pasting from a password manager.

### I don't see a "Change Password" option

If you signed up with Google or Apple and never set a password, you may see "Add Password" instead of "Change Password." That's normal—just create a password there.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will changing my password log me out of the mobile app?

Possibly. For security, changing your password may end other active sessions. You'll just need to sign in again with your new password.

### Can I see my current password somewhere?

No. For security, we never display your password. If you forgot it, use the [password reset](/account/reset-password) feature.

### How often should I change my password?

There's no strict rule, but consider changing it once or twice a year, or immediately if you suspect any security issue.

### Does my password change affect my subscription?

No. Your billing and subscription are completely separate from your password.
