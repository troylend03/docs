# Deleting Your Account

Deleting your Rallies account is permanent. This guide explains what happens when you delete your account, and how to proceed if you're certain.

## Before You Delete: Important Information

> ⚠️ **Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.**

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete your account, we permanently remove:

- Your profile and login credentials
- All watchlists and saved stocks
- Your portfolio data and connected brokerages
- Chat history with the AI
- Price alerts and notification settings
- All personal data associated with your account

### What You'll Lose Access To

- Your Rallies Pro subscription (if applicable)
- Any remaining time on your current billing period
- All research and conversation history
- Any promotional credits or special pricing

### What We Cannot Delete

- **Payment records** — Required for accounting and legal compliance
- **Anonymized, aggregated data** — Used for improving the service (not personally identifiable)

## Consider These Alternatives First

### If You Want to Stop Paying

You don't need to delete your account. Just cancel your subscription:
- Your account stays active on the Free tier
- Your data is preserved
- You can resubscribe anytime

### If You're Getting Too Many Emails

Adjust your notification preferences instead:
- Turn off marketing emails
- Customize which alerts you receive
- Keep your account but reduce communications

[Manage notification preferences →](/account/notifications)

### If You're Taking a Break

Consider just not using Rallies for a while:
- Your account and data stay safe
- No action needed
- Come back whenever you're ready

### If You Have Concerns About Your Data

## How to Delete Your Account

If you're certain you want to proceed:

### Step 1: Cancel Any Active Subscription

If you have Rallies Pro, cancel it first:

**For web subscriptions:**
1. Go to Settings → Subscription
2. Click "Cancel subscription"
3. Complete the cancellation

**For iOS (App Store) subscriptions:**
1. Go to iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions
2. Cancel the Rallies subscription

**For Android (Google Play) subscriptions:**
1. Go to Play Store → Menu → Subscriptions
2. Cancel the Rallies subscription

> ⚠️ **Important:** If you delete your account without canceling a mobile subscription, Apple/Google may continue charging you. Always cancel mobile subscriptions through Apple/Google before deleting.

### Step 2: Disconnect Brokerages (Optional)

If you've connected brokerage accounts, you may want to disconnect them first:

1. Go to Settings → Portfolio
2. Find connected accounts
3. Click "Disconnect" for each

This isn't required—we'll disconnect them automatically when you delete—but some users prefer to do it manually.

### Step 3: Download Your Data (Optional)

If you want a copy of your data before deletion:

1. Go to Settings → Account → Privacy
2. Click "Download my data" or "Export data"
3. Wait for the download to be prepared (may take a few minutes)
4. Download the file

### Step 4: Delete Your Account

**On Web:**

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai) and sign in
2. Click your **profile icon** → **Settings**
3. Click the **"Account"** tab
4. Scroll down to find **"Delete Account"**
5. Click **"Delete Account"**
6. Read the warning carefully
7. Enter your password to confirm
8. Type "DELETE" (or similar confirmation phrase) when prompted
9. Click **"Permanently Delete Account"**

**On Mobile:**

1. Open Rallies app → Settings → Account
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Tap "Delete Account"
4. Confirm with password
5. Confirm final deletion

### Step 5: Confirmation

After deletion:
- You'll be signed out immediately
- You'll receive a confirmation email
- Your account will be queued for deletion

## What Happens After Deletion

### Immediately

- You're signed out of all devices
- You can no longer sign in with those credentials
- Confirmation email sent

### Within 24-48 Hours

- Your data is removed from our active systems
- Watchlists, portfolios, and settings are deleted

### Within 30 Days

- Your data is purged from our backup systems
- Some anonymized, aggregated data may be retained for analytics

### What Stays

- Records of payments (legal requirement)
- Any content you shared that was made public (none currently)
- Aggregated, anonymized usage statistics

## Re-Creating an Account

After deleting your account:

- You can create a new account with the same email
- Your old data will NOT be restored—it's permanently gone
- You'll start fresh as a new user
- Any previous Pro subscription or pricing won't carry over

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Delete Account option"

The option is typically at the bottom of Settings → Account. If you can't find it:
- Make sure you're on the Account/Privacy section
- Try using the web version (more complete settings)
- [Contact support](/support/contact) if you still can't locate it

### "I was charged after deleting my account"

If you subscribed via App Store or Google Play, you must cancel through Apple/Google before deleting. Deleting your Rallies account doesn't automatically cancel mobile subscriptions.

To resolve:
1. Request a refund from Apple/Google
2. Cancel the subscription in your phone settings
3. [Contact us](/support/contact) if you need help

### "I deleted my account by accident"

Unfortunately, account deletion is permanent. We cannot restore deleted accounts or data. If you deleted by accident, you can create a new account, but your previous data is gone.

### "I want to delete but forgot my password"

1. [Reset your password](/account/reset-password) first
2. Sign in with the new password
3. Then delete your account

### "I can't sign in to delete my account"

[Contact support](/support/contact) with:
- The email address of the account to delete
- Reason for deletion
- Any verification info you can provide

We can delete your account on your behalf after verifying your identity.
