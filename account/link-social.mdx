# Linking Social Accounts (Google/Apple)

You can link Google or Apple to your Rallies account for faster, one-click sign-in.

## Benefits of Linking

- **Faster login** - One click instead of typing password
- **No password needed** - Use Face ID, Touch ID, or Google
- **More secure** - Leverage Google/Apple's security
- **Account recovery** - Alternative way to access your account

## Linking Google

### On Web

1. Go to **Settings → Account → Connected Accounts**
2. Click **"Connect Google"**
3. Sign in to your Google account (if not already)
4. Click **"Allow"** to grant Rallies permission
5. Google is now linked

### On Mobile

1. Open **Settings → Account**
2. Tap **"Connected Accounts"** or **"Link Google"**
3. Sign in with Google
4. Confirm the connection

## Linking Apple

### On Web

1. Go to **Settings → Account → Connected Accounts**
2. Click **"Connect Apple"**
3. Sign in with your Apple ID
4. Choose to share or hide your email
5. Apple is now linked

### On iOS

1. Open **Settings → Account**
2. Tap **"Connect Apple"**
3. Confirm with Face ID or Touch ID
4. Apple is now linked

## Unlinking an Account

To remove a connected account:

1. Go to **Settings → Account → Connected Accounts**
2. Find the account you want to unlink
3. Click **"Disconnect"** or **"Remove"**
4. Confirm the removal

**Important:** Make sure you have a password set or another login method before unlinking, or you may lose access.

## Multiple Connected Accounts

You can link both Google AND Apple to the same Rallies account:

- Use whichever is most convenient at the time
- Both will sign you into the same account
- Your data is the same regardless of how you sign in

## What Information is Shared

### From Google
- Email address
- Name
- Profile picture (optional)

### From Apple
- Email (real or hidden relay address)
- Name

We **never** access:
- Your contacts
- Your calendar
- Your files
- Other personal data

## Troubleshooting

### "Account already linked"

This Google/Apple account is connected to a different Rallies account. You'll need to:
1. Unlink it from the other account first
2. Or sign in with that account instead

### "Email already exists"

Your Google/Apple email matches an existing Rallies account. Try:
1. Signing in with your password instead
2. Using "Forgot Password" to recover that account
3. Contact support to merge accounts

### Link button not working

1. Check that pop-ups are enabled
2. Disable browser extensions temporarily
3. Try a different browser
4. Clear your cache and cookies

### Apple "Hide My Email" issues

If you used "Hide My Email" with Apple:
- Your relay address still receives emails from us
- Check your Apple ID settings if emails aren't forwarding
- Your real email is never exposed to us

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I sign up with Google/Apple and later add a password?

Yes. Go to Settings → Account → Password → "Set Password" to add a traditional password to your account.

### What happens if I change my Google/Apple email?

The connection is based on your Google/Apple account ID, not email. Changing your email there won't affect your Rallies login.

### Can I link a Google account that's different from my Rallies email?

Yes. Your Rallies account email and connected Google email don't need to match.

### If I delete my Google/Apple account, will I lose Rallies access?

Only if that's your only login method. Set a password first to ensure you can still access Rallies.

### Is linking required?

No. You can continue using email/password login. Linking is optional for convenience.
