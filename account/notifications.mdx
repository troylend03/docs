## Email vs. Push vs. In-App

You can control how each notification reaches you:

| Channel | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Email** | Sent to your registered email | Non-urgent updates, digests, receipts |
| **Push** | Pop-up on your phone (requires app) | Time-sensitive alerts like price targets |

For price alerts, we recommend enabling **push notifications** so you don't miss time-sensitive triggers.

## Unsubscribe from Emails

### Unsubscribe from Specific Types

Use the notification settings page to toggle off specific email types. This gives you granular control.

### Unsubscribe via Email Link

Every Rallies email includes an unsubscribe link at the bottom:
- **"Unsubscribe"** — Removes you from that specific email type
- **"Manage preferences"** — Opens your full notification settings

### Unsubscribe from All Marketing

To stop all marketing/promotional emails while keeping essential notifications:

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications**
2. Turn off:
   - Product updates
   - Tips & tutorials
   - Newsletter
3. Leave on:
   - Account & billing
   - Security alerts

> ℹ️ **Note:** You cannot unsubscribe from certain transactional emails like receipts, security alerts, and billing notifications. These are required for your account.

## Notification Quiet Hours

If you don't want notifications at certain times:

**On iOS:**
- Use Focus modes or Do Not Disturb, which will silence Rallies along with other apps

**On Android:**
- Use Do Not Disturb settings to silence during certain hours

**In Rallies settings:**
- Some notification types may have timing options (like digest delivery time)

## Syncing Across Devices

Your notification preferences sync across all your devices:

- Change on iOS → it applies to Android and web

**Exception:** Push notification permissions are device-specific. You need to enable push in your phone settings on each device.
