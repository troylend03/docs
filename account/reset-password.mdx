# Resetting a Forgotten Password

Forgot your password? No problem. You can reset it in a few minutes using your email address.

> 💡 **Signed up with Google or Apple?** You don't have a Rallies password—just click "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Apple" to sign in. If you're having trouble with social login, see [I Can't Log In](/troubleshooting/cant-log-in).

## Reset Your Password on Web

1. Go to [rallies.ai/login](https://rallies.ai/login)

2. Click **"Forgot password?"** below the password field

3. Enter the **email address** associated with your account

4. Click **"Send Reset Link"**

5. Check your email inbox for a message from Rallies
   - Subject: "Reset your password"
   - Sender: noreply@rallies.ai

6. Click the **"Reset Password"** button in the email

7. Enter your **new password**
   - Must be at least 8 characters
   - We recommend mixing letters, numbers, and symbols

8. Click **"Save"** or **"Reset Password"**

9. You're done! Sign in with your new password.

## Reset Your Password on Mobile

### iOS App

1. Open the Rallies app
2. On the login screen, tap **"Forgot password?"**
3. Enter your email address
4. Tap **"Send Reset Link"**
5. Check your email and tap the reset link
6. Create your new password
7. Return to the app and sign in

### Android App

1. Open the Rallies app
2. Tap **"Forgot password?"** on the login screen
3. Enter your email address
4. Tap **"Send Reset Link"**
5. Check your email and tap the reset link
6. Create your new password
7. Return to the app and sign in

## Didn't Receive the Reset Email?

If you don't see the password reset email:

### 1. Check Your Spam/Junk Folder

Reset emails sometimes get filtered. Check:
- Spam folder
- Junk folder
- Promotions tab (Gmail)
- Other/Focused inbox (Outlook)

### 2. Wait a Few Minutes

Email delivery can take up to 10 minutes. If you just requested the reset, give it time.

### 3. Check the Email Address

Make sure you entered the correct email—the one you used when signing up. Common issues:
- Typos (gamil.com instead of gmail.com)
- Using a different email than you registered with

### 4. Request Another Reset

Go back to the forgot password page and request a new link. Each new request invalidates previous links.

### 5. Check if You Used Social Login

If you signed up with "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Apple," you don't have a password with Rallies. Try signing in using those options instead.

## Reset Link Not Working?

If you click the link and get an error:

### "Link expired"

Password reset links expire after **1 hour** for security. Request a new one by going through the forgot password flow again.

### "Link already used"

Each reset link can only be used once. If you've already reset your password, try signing in with your new password. If you need to reset again, request a new link.

### "Invalid link"

The link may have been cut off in your email. Try:
- Copying and pasting the full URL instead of clicking
- Requesting a new reset link
- Using a different browser

## Password Requirements

Your new password must:
- Be at least 8 characters long

We recommend:
- Using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Including numbers and symbols
- Not reusing passwords from other sites
- Using a password manager

## After Resetting Your Password

Once you've reset your password:

- **Sign in everywhere:** You'll be logged out of all devices. Sign back in with your new password.
- **Update saved passwords:** If your browser or password manager saved your old password, update it.
- **Your data is safe:** Resetting your password doesn't affect your watchlists, portfolios, or any other data.

## Security Tips

### If You Didn't Request a Reset

If you receive a password reset email but didn't request one:
- **Don't click the link** - Someone may have entered your email by mistake (or intentionally)
- **Your account is still secure** - The reset only works if someone clicks the link and creates a new password
- **Consider enabling 2FA** - Two-factor authentication adds extra security: [Set up 2FA →](/account/two-factor-authentication)

### Protect Your Account

- Use a unique password you don't use anywhere else
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Be cautious of phishing emails pretending to be from Rallies
- Only reset your password through rallies.ai, never through links from unknown sources

## Can't Access Your Email Anymore?

If you no longer have access to the email address on your account:

1. [Contact support](/support/contact) with:
   - The email address on your account
   - An email address you CAN access
   - Any information to help verify your identity (account creation date, subscription status, connected brokerages, etc.)

2. We'll verify your identity through alternative means

3. Once verified, we can help you update your email and regain access

This process may take 1-2 business days for security verification.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long is the reset link valid?

Reset links expire after 1 hour. If yours expired, simply request a new one.

### Will resetting my password log me out everywhere?

Yes. For security, all active sessions are ended when you reset your password. You'll need to sign in again on all devices.

### Can I use my old password again?

Technically yes, but we don't recommend it. If you're resetting because you forgot it, using the same password defeats the purpose. If you're resetting for security reasons, choose something new.

### What if I remember my password after requesting a reset?

No problem. You can ignore the reset email and continue using your current password. The reset link will simply expire.

### I'm locked out after too many wrong attempts. What do I do?

Wait 15-30 minutes for the lockout to lift, then use "Forgot password?" to reset. This is faster than waiting and guessing again.
