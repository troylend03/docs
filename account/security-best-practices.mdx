# Account Security Best Practices

Protecting your Rallies account helps keep your investment research private and secure.

## Strong Password

### Requirements
- At least 8 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols recommended

### Best Practices
- **Use a unique password** - Don't reuse passwords from other sites
- **Use a password manager** - Tools like 1Password, Bitwarden, or Apple Keychain
- **Avoid personal info** - Don't use birthdays, names, or common words
- **Make it long** - Longer passwords are stronger (12+ characters ideal)

### Example of a Strong Password
```
Tr@ding2024!Secure
```

Better yet, use a random password generator:
```
k8$mP2nX@qL9vR4w
```

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA adds a second layer of security beyond your password.

### How It Works
1. Enter your password
2. Enter a code from your authenticator app
3. Only then are you logged in

### Benefits
- Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account
- Protects against phishing attacks
- Industry-standard security measure

## Link Google or Apple Sign-In

Social sign-in leverages the security of Google and Apple:

- **Google:** Uses Google's advanced threat protection
- **Apple:** Uses Face ID/Touch ID for biometric security

Both are more secure than a simple password.

## Recognize Phishing Attempts

### Red Flags
- Emails asking for your password (we never do this)
- Urgent messages about "account suspension"
- Links that don't go to rallies.ai
- Misspelled domains (raIlies.ai, rallles.ai)
- Requests to "verify" by entering credentials

### Safe Practices
- **Check the URL** - Always verify you're on rallies.ai
- **Don't click email links** - Go directly to the site instead
- **When in doubt, don't** - Contact support to verify
- **Report phishing** - Forward suspicious emails to support

## Keep Your Email Secure

Your email is the key to your account (password resets go there):

- Use a strong, unique password for your email
- Enable 2FA on your email account
- Don't share your email password with anyone

## Session Security

### Sign Out on Shared Devices
- Always log out when using public computers
- Don't check "Remember me" on shared devices
- Close the browser when done

### Review Active Sessions
1. Go to **Settings → Security → Active Sessions**
2. Review devices logged into your account
3. Click **"Sign out"** on any you don't recognize

## Suspicious Activity

### Warning Signs
- Login alerts from unknown locations
- Password reset emails you didn't request
- Changes to your account you didn't make
- Missing watchlists or settings changes

### What to Do
1. **Change your password immediately**
2. **Enable 2FA** if not already enabled
3. **Review active sessions** and sign out unknown devices
4. **Contact support** if you believe you were compromised
