# Understanding AI Limitations

The AI Research Assistant is a powerful tool, but it's not magic. Understanding what it can and can't do helps you use it effectively and interpret its responses appropriately. This article covers the key limitations you should know about.

## What the AI Cannot Do

### 1. Predict the Future

The AI cannot tell you:
- Where a stock price will be tomorrow, next month, or next year
- Whether the market will go up or down
- Which stocks will outperform
- When to time your buys and sells

**Why:** Financial markets are inherently unpredictable. No AI, algorithm, or human can consistently predict stock prices. Anyone claiming otherwise is misleading you.

**What it CAN do:** Analyze historical trends, show you what factors might affect prices, and present various scenarios—but the future remains uncertain.

### 2. Give Personalized Investment Advice

The AI cannot tell you:
- What to buy, sell, or hold
- Whether a stock is right for your portfolio
- How to allocate your investments
- Whether you should invest at all

**Why:** Personalized advice requires knowing your complete financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It also requires registration as an investment advisor. [Learn more →](/ai-assistant/no-recommendations)

**What it CAN do:** Present data, analysis, and multiple perspectives so you can make your own informed decisions.

### 3. Access Private Information

The AI cannot:
- See non-public company information
- Access insider data before it's filed
- Know about deals or news before public announcement
- Read private documents or communications

**Why:** The AI only has access to publicly available information—SEC filings, published financial statements, public news, and market data.

### 4. Execute Trades

The AI cannot:
- Buy or sell stocks for you
- Place orders in your brokerage account
- Manage your portfolio automatically
- Make transactions of any kind

**Why:** Rallies is a research platform, not a brokerage. We don't have access to execute trades, even if you connect your brokerage for portfolio viewing.

### 5. Guarantee Accuracy

The AI cannot guarantee that:
- Every number it provides is correct
- Its analysis is error-free
- Data is completely up-to-date
- Its interpretations are the only valid ones

**Why:** AI can make mistakes. Data sources can have errors or delays. Always verify important information before making decisions.

## Types of AI Errors You Might Encounter

### Hallucinations

Sometimes AI generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. This might include:
- Inventing statistics that don't exist
- Attributing quotes to people who didn't say them
- Creating facts that sound reasonable but aren't true

**How to protect yourself:** For important decisions, verify key facts using the stock pages, official SEC filings, or other authoritative sources.

### Outdated Information

The AI pulls from regularly updated databases, but:
- There can be delays between events and data updates
- Breaking news may not be immediately reflected
- Historical training data may contain outdated context

**How to protect yourself:** For time-sensitive questions, check the data timestamp or verify with real-time sources.

### Calculation Errors

Occasionally the AI might:
- Make arithmetic mistakes
- Misapply formulas
- Compare metrics incorrectly

**How to protect yourself:** If numbers seem off, ask the AI to show its work or check calculations on the stock page directly.

### Misinterpretation

The AI might:
- Misunderstand your question
- Focus on the wrong aspect of your query
- Give a technically correct but unhelpful answer

**How to protect yourself:** Be specific in your questions. If the answer misses the mark, rephrase and try again.

## Data Limitations

### Timing and Freshness

| Data Type | Typical Update Frequency |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Stock prices | Real-time (Pro) or 15-min delayed (Free) |
| Financial statements | When companies report (quarterly) |
| Analyst estimates | As analysts update (varies) |
| SEC filings | As filed (usually same day) |
| News | As published (varies) |
| Insider transactions | As filed (up to 2 business days after trade) |

### Coverage Gaps

The AI may have limited or no data for:
- Very small or newly public companies
- International stocks (coverage varies by market)
- OTC/pink sheet stocks
- Certain alternative assets
- Very recent IPOs

If the AI says it doesn't have data on something, it's being honest—not broken.

### Historical Depth

Historical data availability varies:
- Price data: Often 10+ years
- Financial statements: Typically 5-10 years
- Analyst estimates: Usually 2-3 years
- News archives: Varies significantly

## Regulatory Limitations

Some limitations exist because of financial regulations, not technical constraints:

| Limitation | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| No buy/sell recommendations | Requires RIA registration |
| No personalized advice | Requires knowing your situation + registration |
| No specific price predictions | Would constitute market manipulation |
| No guaranteed returns | Would be fraudulent |

These aren't bugs—they're features that keep you (and us) compliant with securities law.

## How to Work Within These Limitations

### Verify Important Information

Before acting on any AI-provided information:
- Cross-reference with the stock page data
- Check official sources (SEC EDGAR, company investor relations)
- Look at multiple data points, not just one

### Use the AI as a Starting Point

Think of the AI as a research assistant, not an oracle:
- Use it to gather information and identify questions
- Form your own conclusions from the data
- Consult professionals for significant decisions

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

If something seems wrong or unclear:
- Ask the AI to explain its reasoning
- Request sources or data points
- Rephrase your question for clarity

### Report Errors

Help us improve by reporting inaccurate responses:
- Use the feedback buttons (👍 👎) on AI responses
- Be specific about what was wrong
- This helps us identify and fix issues

## What We're Doing to Improve

We continuously work to make the AI more accurate and helpful:

- **Regular data updates** from multiple financial data providers
- **Model improvements** to reduce errors and hallucinations
- **User feedback integration** to fix reported issues
- **Expanded coverage** for more securities and data types
- **Better guardrails** to catch potential errors before they reach you

## The Bottom Line

The AI Research Assistant is a powerful tool that can save you hours of research—but it's a tool, not a replacement for your judgment. Use it to inform your thinking, not to make decisions for you. Verify important information. And remember that investing always involves uncertainty that no AI can eliminate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate is the AI?

The AI is generally reliable for factual financial data (pulling from professional data sources), but like any AI, it can make mistakes. Accuracy varies by question type—simple data lookups are more reliable than complex analysis or predictions. Always verify important information.

### What should I do if I think the AI made a mistake?

Use the feedback button (👎) to report the issue. You can also ask the AI to double-check its answer or show its sources. For critical decisions, verify with official sources.

### Is the AI getting better over time?

Yes. We regularly update the AI's capabilities, data sources, and accuracy. User feedback directly informs improvements.

### Should I trust the AI for important investment decisions?

Use the AI as one input among many. For significant financial decisions, verify information independently and consider consulting a qualified financial advisor.
