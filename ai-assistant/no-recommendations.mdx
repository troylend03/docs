# Why the AI Can't Give Buy/Sell Recommendations

If you've asked the Rallies AI "Should I buy this stock?" and didn't get a direct answer, this article explains why—and shows you how to get the research you need to make your own informed decision.

## The Short Answer

Rallies.ai is an investment research platform, not a registered investment advisor. Providing personalized buy, sell, or hold recommendations requires regulatory registration and compliance obligations we don't have. More importantly, no AI can know your complete financial situation—the information needed to give you truly personalized advice.

## The Legal Reason

In the United States, providing personalized investment advice is a regulated activity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires anyone who:

- Gives advice about securities
- To specific people
- For compensation

...to register as an Investment Adviser and comply with extensive regulations designed to protect investors.

Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs) have legal obligations including:

- **Fiduciary duty** - They must act in your best interest
- **Know your customer** - They must understand your full financial situation
- **Suitability requirements** - Recommendations must be appropriate for you specifically
- **Disclosure requirements** - They must disclose conflicts of interest
- **Regulatory oversight** - They're examined by the SEC or state regulators

Rallies is not registered as an investment adviser. We're a technology platform that provides research tools and educational content. This means we cannot tell you what to buy, sell, or hold—that would be providing investment advice without the proper registration.

## The Practical Reason

Even if regulations didn't exist, the AI genuinely cannot give you good personalized advice because it doesn't know:

- **Your income and expenses**
- **Your total assets and debts**
- **Your other investments** (401k, IRA, real estate, etc.)
- **Your tax situation**
- **Your time horizon** (when you need the money)
- **Your risk tolerance** (how you'd react to losses)
- **Your financial goals** (retirement, house, education, etc.)
- **Your personal circumstances** (job stability, dependents, health, etc.)

A stock that's perfect for a 25-year-old with decades until retirement might be completely wrong for someone retiring next year. The AI can't know which you are—and even if it did, it's not qualified to make that judgment.

## What the AI CAN Do

The AI is designed to help you research, not decide. Here's what it does well:

### Present Data and Analysis

> ✓ "What are Apple's profit margins and how have they changed?"
> 
> ✓ "Compare Tesla and Ford on valuation metrics"
> 
> ✓ "What does Apple's balance sheet look like?"

### Show Multiple Perspectives

> ✓ "What's the bull case for this stock?"
> 
> ✓ "What are the main risks?"
> 
> ✓ "What are analysts saying—both bullish and bearish?"

### Explain Concepts

> ✓ "What does P/E ratio mean and why does it matter?"
> 
> ✓ "How do I evaluate a dividend stock?"
> 
> ✓ "What should I look for in a company's cash flow statement?"

### Provide Context

> ✓ "How does this company compare to its competitors?"
> 
> ✓ "What's the historical valuation range for this stock?"
> 
> ✓ "What happened in their last earnings report?"

## How to Get What You Need

Instead of asking for recommendations, try reframing your questions:

| Instead of... | Try asking... |
|---------------|---------------|
| "Should I buy Tesla?" | "What are the main arguments for and against owning Tesla?" |
| "Is Apple a good investment?" | "How does Apple's valuation compare to its growth rate and competitors?" |
| "Should I sell?" | "What are the biggest risks facing this company right now?" |
| "What stocks should I buy?" | "What factors make a stock suitable for [your goal, e.g., dividend income, growth]?" |
| "Is this stock right for me?" | "What type of investor would this stock be appropriate for?" |

The AI can give you tremendous depth on any of these reframed questions—enough to help you make your own informed decision.

## What About Other AI Tools?

You might wonder: "ChatGPT will tell me to buy stocks. Why won't Rallies?"

A few things to consider:

1. **General AI tools aren't financial products.** They're not built for investing and may not understand regulatory boundaries.

2. **They're often just making things up.** Without real-time data, general AI tools may give confident-sounding but outdated or fabricated financial information.

3. **"Advice" without data isn't really advice.** If an AI doesn't know current prices, recent earnings, or your situation, any "recommendation" is essentially random.

4. **Liability matters.** Rallies is a financial research product. We take compliance seriously because our users are making real investment decisions.

We believe giving you solid research to make your own decision is more valuable—and more honest—than pretending we can tell you what to do.

## The Role of Financial Advisors

For personalized advice, consider working with a qualified professional:

- **Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs)** - Fee-based advisors with fiduciary duty
- **Certified Financial Planners (CFPs)** - Professionals trained in comprehensive financial planning
- **Fee-only advisors** - Advisors who don't earn commissions on products they recommend

These professionals can review your complete financial picture and provide the personalized guidance that no app can give.

Rallies can complement an advisor by helping you do research, understand concepts, and come to conversations informed—but it's not a replacement for professional advice when you need it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### But I just want a quick opinion—can't you give me that?

We understand the desire for a simple answer. But investment decisions involve your specific situation, and a "quick opinion" without that context could be harmful. The AI can give you a quick summary of bull/bear arguments, which helps you form your own opinion.

### What if I explicitly say I'm okay with it not being personalized advice?

The regulatory issue isn't about disclaimers—it's about the nature of the service. Providing specific recommendations to individuals (regardless of disclaimers) is investment advice. We've designed the product to help you research, which we can do without registration.

### Can the AI at least tell me what analysts recommend?

Yes! The AI can share analyst ratings, consensus recommendations, and price targets. That's reporting what others say—not the AI making its own recommendation.

> Try: "What are analysts saying about [stock]? What's the consensus rating and price target?"

### Why does the AI Arena show stocks "picked" by AI?

AI Arena is an educational demonstration using simulated trades with fake money. It shows how different AI approaches might analyze stocks—not recommendations for what you should buy. [Learn more about AI Arena →](/ai-arena/overview)
