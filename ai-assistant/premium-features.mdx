## Real-Time Data in AI Responses

| Data Type | Free | Pro |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Stock prices | 15-min delayed | Real-time |
| Market data | 15-min delayed | Real-time |

When analyzing momentum or comparing current prices to historical levels during market hours, real-time data ensures accuracy. For time-sensitive research during volatile moments, 15 minutes can mean significant price changes.

## Advanced Portfolio AI Analysis

### Basic (Free) vs. Advanced (Pro)

**Free Tier:** View holdings, basic performance summary, simple allocation breakdown

**Pro Tier:** Everything in Free, plus:
- Risk analysis and concentration warnings
- Sector and geographic exposure insights
- Correlation analysis between holdings
- AI-generated portfolio review
- Comparison to benchmarks

### Portfolio AI Capabilities (Pro)

Ask about your portfolio:
> "What's my portfolio's sector concentration?"
> "Am I too exposed to tech stocks?"
> "How correlated are my holdings?"

Run portfolio-wide analysis:
> "Review my portfolio and highlight any concerns"
> "What are the strongest and weakest positions?"

## Priority Processing

During high-traffic periods, Pro users receive priority in the processing queue:

- **Faster response times** when the platform is busy
- **More consistent performance** during market volatility
- **Reduced wait times** for Deep Research reports

This matters most during market open/close, major news events, and earnings season.

## Additional Pro Perks

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Real-time price alerts | Alert triggers on actual current price, not 15-min delayed |
| Advanced screener filters | More financial metrics and custom combinations |
| Data export | Download research conversations and Deep Research reports |
| Priority support | Faster response times when you need help |

## Comparing the Experience

> **Query 1:** "What are Apple's profit margins?"
> *Thinks: "That's 1 of my weekly queries..."*
> **Query 2:** "How does that compare to Microsoft?"
> *Ends research early to preserve queries*

### Pro User Research Session

> **Query 1:** "What are Apple's profit margins?"

> **Query 3:** "And compared to the tech sector average?"
