# Getting Better Answers: Prompt Tips

The AI Research Assistant can do a lot, but the quality of your answers depends partly on how you ask. These tips will help you get more useful, accurate, and relevant responses.

## The Golden Rule: Be Specific

The more specific your question, the better your answer.

| Vague Question | Specific Question |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Tell me about Tesla" | "What are Tesla's gross margins and how have they changed over the last 3 years?" |
| "Is Apple good?" | "What are the bull and bear arguments for Apple at its current valuation?" |
| "What about dividends?" | "Which S&P 500 stocks have increased dividends for 25+ consecutive years?" |

Vague questions get vague answers. Specific questions get actionable research.

## 7 Tips for Better Questions

### 1. Use Ticker Symbols

Ticker symbols are unambiguous. Company names can be confusing.

- ✓ "What's AAPL's P/E ratio?"
- ✗ "What's Apple's P/E ratio?" (Works, but less precise)
- ✓ "Compare GOOGL and MSFT on profit margins"
- ✗ "Compare Google and Microsoft" (Google could mean Alphabet Class A or C shares)

### 2. Specify Time Periods

Financial data is time-dependent. Tell the AI what period you care about.

- ✓ "What was Amazon's revenue growth from 2020 to 2024?"
- ✓ "How have Netflix's margins changed over the last 5 years?"
- ✓ "What was Tesla's gross margin last quarter?"
- ✗ "What's Amazon's revenue growth?" (Which period?)

### 3. Ask for Comparisons

Comparative analysis is often more useful than looking at one stock in isolation.

- "Compare Costco and Walmart on operating margins"
- "How does AMD's valuation compare to Nvidia and Intel?"
- "Rank the big banks by return on equity"
- "Which has grown faster: Microsoft's cloud or Amazon's?"

### 4. Request Specific Metrics

If you know what metric you want, ask for it directly.

**Valuation:** P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio
**Profitability:** Gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROE, ROA, ROIC
**Growth:** Revenue growth, earnings growth, free cash flow growth
**Financial Health:** Debt-to-equity, current ratio, interest coverage

Example: "What's NVDA's EV/EBITDA compared to its 5-year average?"

### 5. Ask for Both Sides

Avoid confirmation bias by asking for balanced analysis.

- "What are the bull and bear cases for [stock]?"
- "What are the biggest risks facing [company]?"
- "What could go wrong with this investment thesis?"
- "What are analysts who are bearish on [stock] saying?"

### 6. Use Follow-Up Questions

The AI remembers your conversation. Build on previous answers instead of starting over.

**Effective follow-up sequence:**

> **You:** Give me an overview of Nvidia's business.
> 
> **You:** What are their profit margins?
> 
> **You:** How does that compare to AMD?
> 
> **You:** What's driving the difference?
> 
> **You:** What are the main risks to Nvidia's margins?

Each follow-up drills deeper without repeating context.

### 7. Specify the Format You Want

Tell the AI how you want information presented.

- "Give me a quick summary in 3 bullet points"
- "Explain this like I'm new to investing"
- "Create a comparison table of these 5 stocks"
- "Walk me through this step by step"
- "Give me the detailed version with numbers"

## Power Prompts to Try

### For Stock Analysis

```
"Give me the bull and bear case for [TICKER], focusing on 
valuation, competitive position, and growth outlook."
```

```
"What would a value investor think about [TICKER] at its 
current price? Include specific metrics."
```

```
"Summarize [TICKER]'s last earnings report. What did 
management say about guidance?"
```

### For Portfolio Analysis

```
"Look at my portfolio and identify any concentration risks 
or gaps in diversification."
```

```
"Which of my holdings has the highest valuation relative 
to its growth rate?"
```

```
"If interest rates rise 1%, which of my stocks would be 
most affected and why?"
```

### For Learning

```
"Explain [concept] like I'm new to investing. Use a 
simple analogy."
```

```
"What metrics should I look at when evaluating a 
[type of stock, e.g., bank, REIT, tech company]?"
```

```
"Walk me through how to read an income statement, 
using [TICKER] as an example."
```

### For Screening

```
"Find me stocks with: P/E under 15, dividend yield over 3%, 
and positive earnings growth last 5 years."
```

```
"What are some high-quality companies trading below their 
5-year average valuation?"
```

```
"Which tech stocks have the strongest free cash flow 
relative to their market cap?"
```

## What to Do When Answers Aren't Helpful

### If the answer is too general

Add more specifics to your question:
- Include ticker symbols
- Specify time periods
- Name the exact metrics you want
- Ask for numbers, not just descriptions

### If the answer seems wrong

- Ask the AI to show its sources or data
- Try rephrasing the question
- Ask about a specific metric directly to verify
- Check the data on the stock page yourself
- Report the issue using the feedback button

### If the AI won't answer

The AI declines certain questions for good reasons:
- It won't give buy/sell recommendations (regulatory compliance)
- It won't predict specific future prices (nobody can)
- It won't provide personalized advice (requires knowing your full situation)

Try reframing: instead of "Should I buy TSLA?" ask "What are the arguments for and against owning TSLA?"

### If you hit your query limit

Free accounts have weekly limits. You can:
- Wait for your limit to reset (Mondays)
- [Upgrade to Pro](/billing/upgrade) for unlimited queries
- Use the stock pages and screener, which don't count against your chat limit

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't ask the AI to predict the future**
- ✗ "Where will AAPL be in 6 months?"
- ✓ "What factors could affect AAPL's stock price over the next year?"

**Don't ask for personal financial advice**
- ✗ "Should I put my 401k in this stock?"
- ✓ "What are the risks of having a concentrated position in one stock?"

**Don't assume the AI knows your situation**
- ✗ "Is this a good investment for me?"
- ✓ "What type of investor would find this stock attractive, and why?"

**Don't use vague references**
- ✗ "What do you think about it?" (What's "it"?)
- ✓ "What do you think about Tesla's current valuation?"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does capitalization matter?

No, "AAPL", "aapl", and "Apple" all work. But ticker symbols are clearer when there's potential ambiguity.

### Can I ask multiple questions at once?

Yes, but simpler questions often get better answers. If you have multiple complex questions, ask them one at a time for more thorough responses.

### How do I get the AI to be more concise?

Just ask: "Give me a brief answer" or "Summarize in 3 bullet points" or "Keep it short."

### Can the AI remember things across different conversations?

No, each new conversation starts fresh. If you want to reference something from a previous chat, you'll need to provide that context again.
