# AI Rate Limits & Usage Caps

The AI Research Assistant has different usage limits depending on your subscription tier. This guide explains what those limits are, why they exist, and how to manage your usage effectively.

## Usage Limits by Tier

### Free Tier

| Limit Type | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| AI queries per week | Limited (resets every Monday) |
| Deep Research reports | Not available |

Free tier users receive a set number of AI queries per week. This allocation resets every Monday at 12:00 AM UTC.

### Pro Tier

| Limit Type | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| AI queries | Unlimited |
| Deep Research reports | Unlimited |

Pro subscribers have unlimited access to the AI Research Assistant with no weekly caps.

## What Counts as a Query

### Each of These Counts as One Query

- Sending a message to the AI
- Asking a follow-up question
- Requesting a clarification
- Running a Deep Research report (Pro only)

### These Do NOT Count

- Viewing previous conversations
- Using the Vibe Screener
- Browsing stock pages
- Setting price alerts
- Managing watchlists

## Checking Your Usage

**On Web:** Click on the AI chat interface and look for the usage indicator near the input field.

**On Mobile:** Open the AI Research Assistant and tap the info icon or look at the header area.

When you're approaching your limit, a warning appears showing queries remaining.

## What Happens When You Hit Your Limit

When you reach your weekly limit:

1. **You'll see a notification** explaining you've reached your cap
2. **The AI input is temporarily disabled** for new queries
3. **You can still** view previous conversations and use all other Rallies features

### The Reset

Your query allocation resets every Monday at 12:00 AM UTC:

| Your Timezone | Reset Time (approximately) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Pacific (PT) | Sunday 4:00 PM |
| Eastern (ET) | Sunday 7:00 PM |
| UK (GMT) | Monday 12:00 AM |

### Instant Access Option

If you need more queries before the reset, upgrade to Pro for immediate unlimited access.

## Why Limits Exist

AI queries have real computational costs. The free tier limits help us:
- Offer a genuinely useful free experience
- Keep the platform sustainable long-term
- Prevent abuse that would degrade service for everyone
- Maintain fast response times for all users

## Making the Most of Your Queries (Free Tier)

### Be Specific

| Less Efficient | More Efficient |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Tell me about Apple" | "What are Apple's key financial metrics: P/E, profit margins, and revenue growth?" |
| "Is this stock good?" | "What are the bull and bear cases for MSFT based on valuation?" |

### Batch Related Questions

Instead of asking three separate questions, ask one comprehensive question:
> "Give me Tesla's key financial metrics including revenue, profit margins, and valuation ratios"

### Use the Stock Pages First

Many data points are available on stock pages without using AI queries. Save your AI queries for analysis and synthesis.

### Leverage Conversation Memory

The AI remembers context within a conversation. Use follow-ups efficiently:
> **Query 1:** "Analyze Apple's financial position"
> **Query 2:** "Compare that to Microsoft" (the AI knows you mean the financial position)

## Pro Unlimited Access

### What "Unlimited" Means

Pro subscribers can:
- Send as many queries as they want
- No weekly caps or resets to track
- Run unlimited Deep Research reports

### Fair Use

While Pro access is unlimited, it's subject to fair use. Automated/scripted access and bulk data extraction are not permitted. Normal research usage has no practical limit.

## Rate Limiting (Speed Limits)

Separate from usage caps, there are speed limits to ensure system stability. Even with unlimited queries (Pro), back-to-back rapid-fire queries may be briefly delayed. Normal conversational pace is never affected.

## Troubleshooting

### "I have queries left but can't send messages"

- Check your internet connection
- Try logging out and back in
- Wait a few minutes for temporary server issues

### "My queries didn't reset on Monday"

- Resets happen at 12:00 AM UTC (may be Sunday evening in your timezone)
- Log out and back in to refresh your session

### "I'm Pro but seeing a limit"

- Check Settings > Subscription to verify your subscription is active
- Verify your payment method is current
- Log out and back in

No. Free tier queries reset every Monday regardless of how many you used.

### Does the free trial have limits?

During a Pro free trial, you have full Pro access including unlimited queries. Limits only apply after the trial if you don't subscribe.
