# Using AI for Stock Analysis

The AI Research Assistant can analyze any stock in depth—from quick overviews to comprehensive 100-point analysis. This guide shows you how to get the most valuable insights for your investment research.

## Quick Stock Overview

Start with a broad overview to understand a company:

**Try asking:**
> "Give me an overview of NVDA"

> "What does CrowdStrike do and how do they make money?"

> "Tell me about Microsoft in 2 minutes"

The AI will provide:
- What the company does
- Key business segments
- Recent performance highlights
- Important metrics at a glance

This is a great starting point before diving deeper.

## Financial Analysis

Dig into the numbers that matter.

### Profitability

> "What are Apple's profit margins?"

> "How has Tesla's gross margin changed over the last 3 years?"

> "Compare Amazon and Walmart on operating margins"

The AI can pull current and historical data on gross margin, operating margin, net margin, and explain trends.

### Growth

> "What's Nvidia's revenue growth rate?"

> "How fast is Microsoft's cloud business growing?"

> "Compare Meta and Google on earnings growth"

Get insights on revenue growth, earnings growth, and segment-level growth for companies with multiple business lines.

### Balance Sheet Health

> "Is Netflix's balance sheet healthy?"

> "How much debt does AT&T have?"

> "What's Apple's cash position?"

Understand a company's financial stability through debt levels, cash reserves, debt-to-equity ratios, and interest coverage.

### Cash Flow

> "What's Amazon's free cash flow?"

> "Is Salesforce generating positive cash flow?"

> "How does Apple use its cash flow?"

Cash flow often tells a different story than earnings—the AI can help you understand it.

## Valuation Analysis

Understand whether a stock might be cheap or expensive.

### Basic Valuation

> "Is Apple expensive right now?"

> "What's Tesla's P/E ratio?"

> "How does Nvidia's valuation compare to AMD?"

### Historical Context

> "How does Amazon's P/E compare to its 5-year average?"

> "Is Disney trading at a premium or discount to historical valuations?"

### Relative Valuation

> "Compare the big tech stocks on valuation metrics"

> "Which semiconductor stock is the cheapest on EV/EBITDA?"

The AI can compare companies on P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio, and other metrics.

## Bull and Bear Analysis

Get balanced perspectives on any stock.

### Both Sides

> "What's the bull and bear case for Tesla?"

> "Give me the arguments for and against owning Meta"

The AI will present:
- **Bull case:** Why investors might be optimistic
- **Bear case:** Risks and concerns
- Key factors to watch

### Just the Risks

> "What are the biggest risks for Nvidia?"

> "What could go wrong with Apple?"

> "What are bears saying about Amazon?"

### Just the Opportunities

> "What's the bull case for this stock?"

> "What catalysts could drive the price higher?"

## Analyst Perspectives

See what Wall Street thinks.

> "What do analysts think about Apple?"

> "What's the analyst price target for Tesla?"

> "How have analyst ratings changed for Netflix recently?"

The AI can show you:
- Consensus rating (buy/hold/sell)
- Average price target
- Range of price targets
- Recent rating changes

## Earnings Analysis

Understand recent and upcoming earnings.

### Last Earnings

> "How did Nvidia's last earnings report go?"

> "Did Apple beat or miss expectations?"

> "Summarize Amazon's most recent quarter"

### Earnings History

> "Has Tesla beaten estimates consistently?"

> "Show me Microsoft's earnings surprises over the last year"

### Upcoming Earnings

> "When does Apple report next?"

> "What are expectations for Google's next earnings?"

## Competitive Analysis

Compare companies against their peers.

> "How does Costco compare to Walmart and Target?"

> "Compare the major cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud"

> "Who are Nvidia's main competitors and how do they stack up?"

Great for understanding industry dynamics and relative positioning.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can the AI tell me if a stock is a good buy?

No. The AI provides data, analysis, and multiple perspectives, but it cannot give personalized buy/sell recommendations. You make the final decision based on your own research and circumstances.

### How current is the financial data?

Financial statements update when companies report (typically quarterly). Market data is real-time for Pro users and 15-minute delayed for free users. The AI will note if data might be outdated.

### Can I analyze stocks from other countries?

Yes, for many international stocks, though coverage varies. US stocks have the most comprehensive data.

### What's the difference between asking the AI and using the stock page?

The stock page shows data in a structured format. The AI can explain, compare, contextualize, and answer specific questions about that data. Use both for the most complete picture.
