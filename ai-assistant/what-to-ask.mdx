# What Can I Ask the AI? (Use Cases)

The AI Research Assistant can help with almost any investing question you have—from understanding a single stock to learning fundamental concepts. Here's what works best and how to get the most out of your research.

## Quick Ideas to Get Started

Not sure where to begin? Try one of these:

- "What should I know about NVDA?"
- "Explain P/E ratio like I'm new to investing"
- "What are the risks of investing in Tesla right now?"
- "Compare Microsoft and Google on profitability"
- "Why did the market drop today?"

## Stock Research

Ask about any publicly traded stock to get data, analysis, and context.

**Company overviews:**
- "Give me an overview of Apple"
- "What does CrowdStrike do?"
- "Tell me about Costco's business model"

**Financial analysis:**
- "What are Nvidia's profit margins?"
- "How has Amazon's revenue grown over the past 5 years?"

## Comparing Stocks

Ask the AI to compare companies side-by-side on any metric.

- "Compare Apple, Microsoft, and Google on revenue growth"
- "Which has better margins: Costco or Walmart?"
- "Compare Tesla and Ford on profitability and growth"
- "Rank the big banks by dividend yield"
- "How do AMD and Intel compare on R&D spending?"

## Portfolio Questions

If you've connected your brokerage or entered holdings, ask about your portfolio.

**Performance:**
- "How is my portfolio doing?"
- "What's my best performer this year?"
- "Which of my stocks has dropped the most?"

**Analysis:**
- "Am I too concentrated in any sector?"
- "What's my portfolio's exposure to tech?"
- "Do I have any overlapping holdings?"

**Risk:**
- "What are the biggest risks in my portfolio?"
- "How would my portfolio do if interest rates rise?"
- "Which of my holdings are most volatile?"

## Learning & Education

**Financial metrics:**

## Smart Money Tracking

Ask about what politicians and institutions are doing.

- "Has Nancy Pelosi made any recent trades?"
- "Which hedge funds own Apple?"
- "What did Warren Buffett buy last quarter?"
- "Show me the latest 13F filings for Tesla"

## Screener-Style Questions

Instead of using filters, describe what you're looking for.

- "Find me undervalued tech stocks"
- "What are some high-dividend stocks with low payout ratios?"
- "Show me small-cap stocks with strong revenue growth"
- "Which stocks have beaten earnings estimates the last 4 quarters?"
- "Find me companies with low debt and high free cash flow"

## What the AI Won't Do

The AI is designed to provide research and education, not personalized advice. There are some things it won't help with:

**It won't give buy/sell recommendations:**
- ❌ "Should I buy Tesla?"
- ❌ "Is now a good time to sell Apple?"
- ❌ "What stocks should I buy?"

**It won't provide personalized advice:**
- ❌ "Is this stock right for my retirement portfolio?"
- ❌ "How should I allocate my 401k?"
- ❌ "Should I invest my savings in crypto?"

**It won't predict the future:**
- ❌ "Where will NVDA stock be in a year?"
- ❌ "Is the market going to crash?"
- ❌ "What will Amazon's earnings be next quarter?"

**Instead, try reframing:**
- ✓ "What factors might affect Tesla's stock price?"
- ✓ "What do analysts think about Apple's outlook?"
- ✓ "What are the bull and bear arguments for this stock?"

## Tips for Better Questions

1. **Be specific** - "What are Nvidia's gross margins for the last 3 years?" gets better results than "Tell me about Nvidia's finances."

2. **Use ticker symbols** - "AAPL" is more precise than "Apple" (which could mean the company or the fruit).

3. **Ask follow-ups** - The AI remembers your conversation. After asking about a stock, you can ask "How does that compare to last year?" without repeating the ticker.

4. **Request comparisons** - "Compare X and Y on Z" is a powerful pattern for analysis.

5. **Ask for explanations** - If you don't understand something in a response, ask the AI to explain further.

The AI covers most publicly traded U.S. stocks, ETFs, and many international securities. If it doesn't have data on a specific security, it will let you know.

### Does the AI remember previous questions?

Yes, within the same conversation. You can ask follow-up questions like "What about their dividend?" and the AI will know which stock you're discussing. Starting a new conversation clears this context.

### How current is the information?

The AI pulls from regularly updated data sources including recent earnings reports, SEC filings, and market data. For the most time-sensitive questions (like today's price movements), it uses real-time data for Pro users and 15-minute delayed data for free users.
