# Billing Cycles & Renewal Dates

Your Rallies subscription renews automatically based on when you first subscribed. Here's how billing cycles work.

## How Billing Cycles Work

### Monthly Subscriptions

- **Cycle length:** 30 days from your signup date
- **Renewal:** Automatic on the same date each month
- **Example:** If you subscribed on January 15, you'll be billed on the 15th of each month

### Annual Subscriptions

- **Cycle length:** 365 days from your signup date
- **Renewal:** Automatic on the same date each year
- **Savings:** Annual plans save approximately 17% compared to monthly billing

## Finding Your Renewal Date

### On Web

1. Click your **profile icon** in the top right
2. Select **"Settings"**
3. Go to **"Billing"** or **"Subscription"**
4. Your renewal date is displayed under "Next billing date"

### On Mobile

1. Tap **"Settings"** (gear icon)
2. Tap **"Subscription"**
3. View your renewal date at the top of the screen

## What Happens on Renewal

On your renewal date:

1. **Payment is processed** using your saved payment method
2. **Receipt is sent** to your email
3. **Subscription continues** with no interruption
4. **New billing cycle** begins

If your payment fails, we'll:
- Retry the charge after 24 hours
- Send you an email notification
- Give you a grace period to update your payment method

## Changing Your Billing Cycle

### Switch from Monthly to Annual

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Switch to Annual"**
3. You'll receive a prorated credit for your current month
4. The annual subscription starts immediately

### Switch from Annual to Monthly

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Switch to Monthly"**
3. The change takes effect at your next renewal date
4. You'll keep annual pricing until then

## Prorated Billing

When you upgrade mid-cycle, we use prorated billing:

- **What it means:** You only pay for the remaining days in your cycle
- **How it works:** We calculate the daily rate and charge accordingly
- **Example:** Upgrading 15 days into a 30-day cycle means you pay 50% of the upgrade cost

## Viewing Billing History

To see past charges and invoices:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Billing History"** or **"Invoices"**
3. View or download any past invoice

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if my renewal date falls on the 31st?

If you subscribed on the 31st and a month doesn't have 31 days, you'll be billed on the last day of that month.

### Can I change my billing date?

Currently, billing dates are set based on your original signup date and cannot be changed. Contact support if you have specific needs.

### Will I be notified before renewal?

Yes, we send a reminder email 3 days before your annual renewal. Monthly subscribers are not sent reminders but receive receipts after each charge.
