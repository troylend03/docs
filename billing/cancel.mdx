3. Tap **Subscriptions**

4. Find and tap **Rallies**

### After Your Billing Period Ends
- Your account converts to the Free tier

## Check Your Cancellation Status

To confirm your subscription is set to cancel:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Subscription**
2. Look for status showing "Cancels on [date]" or "Will not renew"
3. You should have received a confirmation email

If you don't see confirmation or are still being charged, [contact support](/support/contact) immediately.

## Cancel a Free Trial

If you're on a free trial and want to cancel before being charged:

**On Web:**
Follow the same steps as regular cancellation above. Cancel before your trial end date to avoid being charged.

**On iOS:**
You must cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Apple processes renewals 24 hours early.

**On Android:**
Cancel anytime before your trial end date. Google will confirm when your trial access ends.

## Having Second Thoughts?

**If you haven't canceled yet:**
Consider why you want to cancel:
- **Too expensive?** Check if annual billing saves you money, or contact us about available discounts
- **Not using it enough?** Check out [what to ask the AI](/ai-assistant/what-to-ask) for ideas
- **Missing a feature?** [Tell us what you need](/support/feedback)—we might already be building it
- **Having technical issues?** [Contact support](/support/contact) and we'll help fix them

**If you already canceled:**
You can resubscribe anytime to get Pro back. Your data is waiting for you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I get a refund when I cancel?

Canceling stops future charges but doesn't automatically refund your current period. If you're within 14 days of a new subscription, you may be eligible for a refund. [See refund policy →](/billing/refund-policy)

### Can I cancel anytime?

Yes, there's no contract or commitment. Cancel whenever you want.

### What if I cancel and change my mind?

You can resubscribe anytime. Your Pro access will reactivate immediately, and you'll start a new billing cycle.

### I canceled but was still charged. What happened?

If you were charged after canceling, it's likely because:
- The cancellation didn't process correctly (check your confirmation email)
- You have multiple accounts (one may still be active)
- You canceled after the renewal date for that period

[Contact support](/support/contact) and we'll investigate and refund if appropriate.

### How do I know which platform I subscribed through?

Check **Settings** → **Subscription**. It will show "Billed by Apple," "Billed by Google," or show your card details for web subscriptions.
