# Changing Your Billing Cycle

Want to switch from monthly to annual billing (or vice versa)? Here's how to change your billing cycle.

## Monthly vs. Annual

| | Monthly | Annual |
|---|---------|--------|
| **Payment** | Every month | Once per year |
| **Flexibility** | Cancel anytime | Commit for 12 months |
| **Cost** | Higher per month | ~17% savings |
| **Best for** | Trying Pro, uncertain users | Long-term users |

## Switching from Monthly to Annual

Save money by switching to annual billing:

### On Web

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Change Plan"** or **"Switch to Annual"**
3. Review the new pricing
4. Confirm the change

### What Happens

- **Credit applied:** You get prorated credit for your unused monthly time
- **New charge:** The annual rate is charged (minus your credit)
- **New cycle starts:** Your annual billing date is now today
- **Savings begin:** You're now paying the lower annual rate

**Example:** If you're 15 days into a $20/month subscription and switch to $200/year annual:
- Credit: ~$10 for unused 15 days
- Charge: $200 - $10 = $190
- Next charge: One year from today

## Switching from Annual to Monthly

Want more flexibility? You can switch to monthly:

### On Web

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Change Plan"** or **"Switch to Monthly"**
3. Select monthly billing
4. Confirm the change

### What Happens

- **Change is scheduled:** You keep annual access until your year ends
- **No refund:** Annual payments are typically non-refundable
- **Monthly starts later:** At your annual renewal date, monthly billing begins

**Important:** You won't get a prorated refund when switching from annual to monthly. The change takes effect at your next renewal.

## Timing Your Switch

### Best Time to Go Annual
- Early in your subscription (maximize savings)
- When you're confident you'll use Rallies long-term
- During a promotion or discount offer

### Best Time to Go Monthly
- Near your annual renewal date
- When you're unsure about continuing
- If your usage has decreased

## Proration Explained

When switching to annual mid-cycle:

```
Credit = (Days remaining / Days in month) × Monthly price
New charge = Annual price - Credit
```

The math is handled automatically—you'll see the final amount before confirming.

## App Store / Google Play Subscriptions

If you subscribed through Apple or Google:

### iOS (App Store)
1. Go to **iPhone Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions**
2. Tap **Rallies**
3. Select a different billing option if available
4. Confirm

### Android (Google Play)

2. Find **Rallies**

Note: Options may be limited compared to web subscriptions.
