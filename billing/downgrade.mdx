# How to Downgrade Your Plan

If Rallies Pro isn't the right fit right now, you can downgrade to our free tier anytime. Here's how it works.

## Before You Downgrade

Consider what you'll lose access to:

| Feature | Pro | Free |
|---------|-----|------|
| AI queries | Unlimited | Limited daily |
| Real-time data | ✓ | 15-min delayed |
| Watchlists | Unlimited | Up to 3 |
| Price alerts | Unlimited | Up to 5 |
| Deep Research | ✓ | ✗ |
| AI Arena full access | ✓ | Limited |
| Priority support | ✓ | ✗ |

## How to Downgrade

### On Web

1. Click your **profile icon** → **Settings**
2. Go to **"Billing"** or **"Subscription"**
3. Click **"Change Plan"** or **"Manage Subscription"**
4. Select **"Downgrade to Free"**
5. Confirm your decision

### On Mobile (iOS)

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone/iPad
2. Tap your **Apple ID** at the top
3. Tap **"Subscriptions"**
4. Find **Rallies** and tap it
5. Tap **"Cancel Subscription"**

### On Mobile (Android)

1. Open the **Google Play Store**
2. Tap **Menu → Subscriptions**
3. Find **Rallies** and tap it
4. Tap **"Cancel subscription"**

## When Does the Downgrade Take Effect?

Your downgrade takes effect at the **end of your current billing period**:

- You keep Pro features until your paid period ends
- No prorated refund for unused time (but see our [refund policy](/billing/refund-policy))
- On the last day, your account converts to free tier

**Example:** If your billing date is the 15th and you downgrade on the 5th, you have Pro until the 15th.

## What Happens to Your Data

### Data You Keep

- ✓ Your account and login
- ✓ All conversation history with the AI
- ✓ Up to 3 watchlists (oldest kept if you have more)
- ✓ Your portfolio and holdings
- ✓ Historical performance data

### Features You Lose

- ✗ Unlimited AI queries (limited to daily cap)
- ✗ Real-time price data (switches to 15-min delayed)
- ✗ Extra watchlists beyond 3 (hidden, not deleted)
- ✗ Price alerts beyond 5 (disabled, not deleted)
- ✗ Deep Research mode

### Extra Watchlists & Alerts

If you have more than 3 watchlists or 5 alerts:
- They're **not deleted**, just hidden/disabled
- If you re-upgrade, they'll be restored
- You can choose which to keep before downgrading

## Alternatives to Downgrading

Before you go, consider:

1. **Switch to annual billing** - Save 17% with yearly payment
2. **Pause your subscription** - Take a break instead of canceling (if available)
3. **Contact support** - We may be able to help with your specific situation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I get a refund for unused time?

Generally no, but exceptions may be made. See our [refund policy](/billing/refund-policy) or contact support.

### Can I downgrade mid-month?

Yes, but you'll keep Pro access until your current billing period ends.

### What if I have more than 3 watchlists?

Your extra watchlists are hidden, not deleted. They'll return if you upgrade again. You can also manually delete watchlists to choose which 3 to keep.

### Is downgrading the same as canceling?

Yes, for Rallies "downgrading" and "canceling" are the same—you're moving from Pro to the free tier.
