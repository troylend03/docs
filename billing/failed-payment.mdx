# Failed Payment Troubleshooting

Payment didn't go through? Here's how to diagnose and fix the issue to keep your Rallies Pro subscription active.

## Common Reasons Payments Fail

### Card Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Expired card** | Update with a new expiration date |
| **Insufficient funds** | Add funds or use a different card |
| **Card reported lost/stolen** | Use a different card |
| **Closed account** | Update to an active card |

### Bank Blocks

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Fraud protection triggered** | Contact your bank to approve the charge |
| **International transaction block** | Ask your bank to allow international charges |
| **Subscription block** | Some cards block recurring payments—contact your bank |
| **Daily limit exceeded** | Wait until tomorrow or increase your limit |

### Technical Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Incorrect card number** | Re-enter your card details carefully |
| **Wrong CVV** | Check the 3-4 digit code on your card |
| **Billing address mismatch** | Ensure address matches what's on file with your bank |
| **Browser/network issues** | Try a different browser or device |

## How to Fix a Failed Payment

### Step 1: Check Your Payment Method

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Review your saved payment method
3. Verify the card isn't expired
4. Check that details are correct

### Step 2: Update Payment Method

1. Click **"Update Payment Method"**
2. Enter new card details
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Try the payment again

### Step 3: Contact Your Bank

If your card details are correct, your bank may be blocking the charge:

1. Call the number on the back of your card
2. Ask about the declined transaction
3. Request they approve charges from "Rallies" or "Stripe"
4. Try the payment again

### Step 4: Try a Different Card

If issues persist:
1. Add a different credit or debit card
2. Set it as your default payment method
3. Retry the charge

## Grace Period

When a payment fails:

1. **Immediate:** We notify you via email
2. **24 hours:** First automatic retry
3. **3 days:** Second retry attempt
4. **7 days:** Final retry attempt
5. **After 7 days:** Subscription may be suspended

During this grace period, you typically retain Pro access. Update your payment method promptly to avoid interruption.

## What Happens If Payment Keeps Failing

If we can't process payment after the grace period:

- **Pro features disabled** - You're moved to free tier
- **Data preserved** - Nothing is deleted
- **Easy to restore** - Update payment and your subscription resumes

## Check Payment Status

To see the status of your payment:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Look for **"Payment Status"** or check **"Billing History"**
3. Status shows as Paid, Pending, Failed, or Retrying

## VPN and Security Software

Sometimes VPNs or security software can cause payment issues:

1. **Disable your VPN** temporarily during checkout
2. **Pause ad blockers** - They can interfere with payment forms
3. **Try incognito mode** - Browser extensions won't run

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why was my card declined if I have money?

Banks can decline for many reasons beyond balance: fraud protection, international blocks, daily limits, or card restrictions on recurring payments.

### Will I lose my Pro access immediately?

No. You have a grace period (typically 7 days) to fix your payment method before access is affected.

### Will you keep trying to charge me?

We retry automatically a few times over 7 days. After that, we stop attempting and your subscription is suspended until you update payment.

### Can I use a debit card?

Yes, debit cards work fine. However, some banks are stricter about debit cards for recurring charges. If your debit card is declined, try a credit card.

### What if I'm traveling internationally?

Let your bank know you're traveling, or pre-approve international charges. Some banks auto-block foreign transactions.
