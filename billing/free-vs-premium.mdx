## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch between plans?

Yes. You can upgrade from Free to Pro anytime, and your new features activate immediately. If you downgrade from Pro to Free, you'll keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period. [Learn how to change plans →](/billing/upgrade)

### What happens to my data if I downgrade?

Your data is never deleted when you change plans. If you downgrade from Pro to Free, you'll keep your watchlists, alerts, and portfolios—but you'll be subject to Free tier limits. For example, if you have 10 watchlists, you'll still see them all but won't be able to create new ones until you're under the limit.

### Do you offer refunds?

If you're not satisfied within the first 14 days of a new Pro subscription, contact support for a full refund. [Read our refund policy →](/billing/refund-policy)

### Is there a student or nonprofit discount?

Contact our support team to ask about special pricing for students and nonprofit organizations.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) and debit cards. [See all payment options →](/billing/payment-methods)
