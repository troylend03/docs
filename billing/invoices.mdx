# Understanding Your Invoice

After each payment, Rallies sends you an invoice via email. Here's how to understand what's on it and how to access your billing history.

## What's on Your Invoice

Each invoice includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Invoice Number** | Unique identifier for this invoice |
| **Invoice Date** | When the charge was processed |
| **Billing Period** | The dates your subscription covers |
| **Description** | Plan name (e.g., "Rallies Pro - Monthly") |
| **Amount** | Total charged |
| **Payment Method** | Last 4 digits of the card used |
| **Status** | Paid, Pending, or Failed |

## Discrepancies on Your Invoice

If something looks wrong:

1. **Check the billing period** - Make sure dates match your expectation
2. **Review plan changes** - Did you upgrade or downgrade?
3. **Look for prorations** - Mid-cycle changes create partial charges/credits
4. **Contact support** - We'll investigate any billing issues
