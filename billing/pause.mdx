# Pausing Your Subscription

Need a break from Rallies Pro? Pausing lets you temporarily stop your subscription without fully canceling.

## Pause vs. Cancel

| | Pause | Cancel |
|---|-------|--------|
| **Duration** | 1-3 months | Permanent until you re-subscribe |
| **Billing** | Stops during pause | Stops immediately |
| **Pro access** | Ends during pause | Ends at billing period end |
| **Data** | Preserved | Preserved |
| **Returns automatically** | Yes, at pause end | No, must re-subscribe manually |

## Availability

<Note>
Subscription pausing may not be available for all accounts or subscription types. If you don't see the pause option, canceling and re-subscribing later is your alternative.
</Note>

Pause is typically available if:
- You subscribed through the Rallies website (not App Store/Play Store)
- Your account is in good standing
- You haven't paused recently

## How to Pause Your Subscription

### On Web

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Manage Subscription"**
3. Select **"Pause Subscription"** (if available)
4. Choose your pause duration (1, 2, or 3 months)
5. Confirm the pause

### App Store / Google Play Subscriptions

Apple and Google don't support pausing. Your options are:
- Cancel and re-subscribe later
- Let the subscription continue

## What Happens When You Pause

### Immediately
- Your pause is scheduled for the end of your current billing period
- You keep Pro access until then
- No further charges until you unpause or the pause ends

### During the Pause
- Access reverts to free tier
- No billing occurs
- Your data remains intact
- Watchlists and alerts are preserved (but limited)

### When the Pause Ends
- Billing resumes automatically
- Pro access is restored
- All your data and settings return
- You're charged at your previous rate

## Pause Limits

To prevent abuse, pausing has limits:

- **Maximum duration:** 3 months per pause
- **Frequency:** Once per 12-month period
- **Account standing:** Must be in good standing (no failed payments)

## Unpausing Early

Changed your mind? You can unpause at any time:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Resume Subscription"** or **"Unpause"**
3. Confirm—you'll be charged immediately
4. Pro access restores instantly

## Alternatives to Pausing

If pause isn't available, consider:

1. **Downgrade to annual** - Lower your monthly cost
2. **Cancel and return** - [Re-subscribe when ready](/billing/restart-subscription)
3. **Use free tier** - Many features are still available

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I lose my data if I pause?

No. Your account, watchlists, conversation history, and portfolio data are all preserved during the pause.

### Can I pause if I subscribed through Apple/Google?

Unfortunately, no. Apple and Google don't support subscription pausing. You'll need to cancel and re-subscribe later.

### What happens to my price alerts during pause?

Price alerts beyond the free tier limit (5) are disabled during the pause but automatically re-enable when you unpause.

### Can I pause in the middle of a billing period?

The pause takes effect at the end of your current billing period, not immediately. You keep Pro access until then.

### What if I don't unpause—will I be charged automatically?

Yes. When your pause period ends, billing resumes automatically at your previous rate.
