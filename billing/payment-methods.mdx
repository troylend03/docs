## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use a prepaid card?

Prepaid cards may work but aren't guaranteed. They often get declined for recurring subscriptions because they can't guarantee future charges.

### Will you store my card information?

We store a secure token that represents your card, not the actual card number. This is handled by Stripe and is industry-standard practice.

### Can I pay for a year upfront?

Yes! When you select an annual plan, you pay for the full year upfront and save approximately 17% compared to monthly billing.

### Do you offer invoicing for businesses?

Contact [support](/support/contact) if you need custom invoicing or purchase orders for your organization.
