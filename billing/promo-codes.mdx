## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I apply a code after I've already subscribed?

Sometimes. If the code allows it, you can apply it in Settings → Billing for your next billing cycle. Some codes are new-customer-only.

### Can I use multiple promo codes?

No, only one promo code can be applied per subscription.

### My code worked but the price looks wrong

Some codes apply to the first month/year only, then regular pricing continues. Check the code's terms for details.

### Where can I get a promo code?

Sign up for our newsletter, follow us on social media, or check if any financial content creators you follow have partner codes.

### Can customer support give me a promo code?

Support agents generally cannot create or provide promo codes, but they can help troubleshoot if a valid code isn't working.
