# Refund Policy

We want you to be happy with Rallies Pro. If you're not satisfied, here's what you need to know about refunds.

## Our Refund Policy at a Glance

|-----------|-------------------|
| Within 14 days of new subscription | ✓ Full refund |
| After 14 days | ✗ No refund (keep access until period ends) |
| Cancelled free trial (no charge) | N/A - Nothing to refund |
| Charged by mistake / billing error | ✓ Full refund |
| Duplicate charges | ✓ Full refund of duplicate |
| Forgot to cancel | Case-by-case basis |

## 14-Day Satisfaction Guarantee

If you subscribe to Rallies Pro and aren't satisfied, you can request a full refund within **14 days** of your initial subscription.

**This applies to:**
- New Pro subscriptions (monthly or annual)
- First-time subscribers

**This does not apply to:**
- Renewals of existing subscriptions
- Resubscribing after previously canceling
- Free trial periods (no charge to refund)

### How to Request a 14-Day Refund

1. [Contact support](/support/contact) within 14 days of your subscription start date
2. Include your account email and reason for the refund
3. We'll process your refund within 3-5 business days
4. Your Pro access will be revoked when the refund is processed

## After 14 Days

After the 14-day window, we do not offer refunds for:
- Unused time on monthly subscriptions
- Remaining months on annual subscriptions
- Change of mind or circumstances

**However, you can always cancel:**
- You won't be charged again
- You keep Pro access until your current period ends
- [How to cancel →](/billing/cancel)

## Billing Errors and Mistakes

We will always refund charges that were made in error:

**Duplicate charges:** If you were charged twice for the same period, we'll refund the duplicate.

**Charged after cancellation:** If you properly cancelled but were still charged, we'll refund the charge.

**Wrong amount:** If you were charged more than the correct subscription price, we'll refund the difference.

**Technical errors:** If a system error caused an incorrect charge, we'll make it right.

### How to Report a Billing Error

1. [Contact support](/support/contact) immediately
2. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Date and amount of the incorrect charge
   - What you believe went wrong
3. We'll investigate and respond within 24 hours
4. Valid billing errors are refunded within 3-5 business days

## "Forgot to Cancel" Situations

If you forgot to cancel before a renewal, refunds are evaluated case-by-case:

**We may offer a refund if:**
- You contact us very soon after the renewal (within 48 hours)
- You haven't used Pro features since the renewal
- It's your first time making this request

**We typically don't refund if:**
- Significant time has passed since renewal
- You've actively used Pro features since renewal
- You've previously received a "forgot to cancel" refund

**Our recommendation:** Set a calendar reminder before your renewal date if you're considering canceling.

## Refunds for App Store / Google Play Subscriptions

If you subscribed through iOS (App Store) or Android (Google Play), refunds are handled by Apple or Google—not by Rallies directly.

### Request Refund from Apple

1. Go to [reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Find the Rallies charge
4. Select "Request a refund" and choose your reason
5. Submit the request

Apple makes the final decision on App Store refunds.

### Request Refund from Google

1. Go to [play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory](https://play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory)
2. Find the Rallies subscription
3. Click "Report a problem"
4. Select your reason and request refund
5. Or contact Google Play support directly

Google makes the final decision on Play Store refunds.

### Can Rallies Help with App Store/Play Refunds?

We can't directly process refunds for subscriptions billed through Apple or Google. However, we can:
- Confirm your subscription status
- Provide information to support your refund request
- Help identify billing issues

## Refund Processing Time

Once approved, refunds typically take:

| Payment Method | Processing Time |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Credit card (web) | 3-5 business days |
| Debit card (web) | 3-5 business days |
| Apple App Store | 5-10 business days (Apple's timeline) |
| Google Play | 3-5 business days (Google's timeline) |

Refunds go back to the original payment method. You'll see it as a credit on your statement.

## What Happens After a Refund

When we process a refund:

1. **Pro access is revoked** - Your account moves to the Free tier
2. **Your data is preserved** - Watchlists, portfolios, chat history remain intact
3. **You can resubscribe anytime** - Your data will be there when you return

## Chargebacks and Disputes

If you have a billing concern, please contact us first before disputing with your bank. We can usually resolve issues faster than the chargeback process, and chargebacks can result in your account being suspended.

**If you've already filed a dispute:**
- Your account may be suspended during the investigation
- Contact us to resolve the issue directly
- We're happy to work with you

## Contact Us About Refunds

For all refund requests and billing questions:

**Email:** support@rallies.ai
**Subject line:** "Refund Request" or "Billing Issue"

Include:
- Your account email
- Date and amount of charge
- Reason for refund request

We respond to billing inquiries within 24 hours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get a partial refund for an annual subscription?

We don't offer prorated refunds for annual subscriptions after the 14-day window. If you cancel, you'll keep Pro access until your year ends but won't receive a partial refund.

### What if I subscribed by accident?

Contact us immediately. If you haven't used any Pro features, we'll typically refund accidental purchases regardless of the timeframe.

### Do refunds affect my ability to resubscribe?

No. You can resubscribe anytime after a refund. Your account and data remain intact.

### Can I get a refund if the app isn't working for me?

Contact support first—we may be able to fix the issue. If the problem can't be resolved and you're within 14 days, we'll offer a refund. If you're outside 14 days, we'll evaluate case-by-case.

### What counts as "using Pro features"?

Pro features include: unlimited AI queries, Deep Research, real-time data, advanced portfolio analytics, and data exports. If you've actively used these after renewal, a refund is less likely for "forgot to cancel" requests.
