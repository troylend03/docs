## How to Request a Refund

### For Web Subscriptions

1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **"Request Refund"** if available

**Or contact support:**

1. Go to [support](/support/contact)
2. Select **"Billing Issue"** as the topic
3. Choose **"Refund Request"**
4. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Charge date and amount
   - Reason for refund request
5. Submit your request

### For iOS Subscriptions (Apple)

If you subscribed through the App Store:

2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Find the Rallies charge
4. Select **"Request a refund"**

Apple handles these refunds directly—Rallies cannot process App Store refunds.

### For Android Subscriptions (Google Play)

If you subscribed through Google Play:

1. Go to [play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory](https://play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory)
2. Find the Rallies transaction
3. Click **"Report a problem"**
4. Select **"I'd like to request a refund"**
5. Complete the form

Google handles these refunds directly.

## What to Include in Your Request

To speed up processing, include:

- **Account email** - The email you use for Rallies
- **Charge amount** - Exact amount on your statement
- **Charge date** - When you were billed
- **Reason** - Brief explanation of why you're requesting
- **Last 4 digits** - Of the card that was charged (optional but helpful)

## Refund Timeline

| Type | Processing Time |
|------|-----------------|
| Web subscriptions | 3-5 business days |
| App Store (Apple) | 5-10 business days |
| Google Play | 3-5 business days |
| Bank processing | Additional 3-5 days |

Refunds go back to your original payment method.

## What Happens After a Refund

Once refunded:

1. **Access ends** - Pro features are removed immediately
2. **Account remains** - You keep your free-tier account
3. **Data preserved** - Watchlists, history, portfolio remain
4. **Can re-subscribe** - You can upgrade again anytime

## Partial Refunds

In some cases, we may offer a partial refund:

- Used the service for part of the billing period
- Downgrading from annual to monthly equivalent
- Other case-by-case situations

## Charge Still Showing?

If you requested a refund but still see the charge:

1. **Wait 5-7 business days** - Refunds take time to process
2. **Check pending transactions** - Some banks show refunds as pending first
3. **Look for credit** - It may appear as a separate credit, not reversal
4. **Contact support** - If it's been over 10 business days
