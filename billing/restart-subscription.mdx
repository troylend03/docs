## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I lose my data if I wait too long to re-subscribe?

No. We retain your account data indefinitely. Whether you re-subscribe after a week or a year, your watchlists, history, and portfolio will be there.

### Can I switch from monthly to annual when re-subscribing?

Yes! When you re-subscribe, you can choose either monthly or annual billing. Many people switch to annual to save 17%.

### Will my old price be honored?

Generally, no. You'll pay the current subscription price. If you had a promotional rate, those are typically not renewable.

### What if I was billed by Apple/Google before?

If you originally subscribed through the App Store or Google Play, you'll need to re-subscribe through the same platform to use your original payment method.
