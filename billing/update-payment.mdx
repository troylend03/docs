# Updating Your Payment Method

Need to update your credit card? Whether your card expired, you got a new one, or you just want to switch payment methods, this guide shows you how.

## First: Check How You Subscribed

Your update method depends on how you originally subscribed:

| If you see in Settings... | You subscribed via... | Update payment... |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Card ending in XXXX | Web (direct billing) | In Rallies Settings |
| "Billed by Apple" | iOS App Store | In Apple Settings |
| "Billed by Google" | Google Play Store | In Google Play |

Go to **Settings → Subscription** to see which applies to you.

## Update for Web Subscriptions

If you subscribed on the website (you see your card number in Settings):

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai) and sign in

2. Click your **profile icon** → **Settings**

3. Click the **"Subscription"** tab

4. Find the **Payment Method** section

5. Click **"Update"** or **"Change Payment Method"**

6. Enter your new card information:
   - Card number
   - Expiration date (MM/YY)
   - CVC (3-4 digit security code)
   - Billing ZIP code

7. Click **"Save"** or **"Update Card"**

You'll see a confirmation that your payment method was updated. Your next billing cycle will charge the new card.

## Update for iOS (App Store) Subscriptions

If you subscribed through the iOS app, Apple manages your payment. Update it through Apple:

### On iPhone or iPad

1. Open the **Settings** app

2. Tap your **name** at the top (Apple ID)

3. Tap **"Payment & Shipping"**

4. Tap your current payment method, or tap **"Add Payment Method"**

5. Enter your new card details

6. Tap **"Done"**

Your updated payment method applies to all App Store subscriptions, including Rallies.

### On Mac

1. Open the **App Store**

2. Click your name in the bottom left → **Account Settings**

3. Click **"Manage Payments"**

4. Update or add your payment method

### Via Web

1. Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)

2. Sign in with your Apple ID

3. Go to **"Payment & Shipping"**

4. Update your payment method

## Update for Android (Google Play) Subscriptions

If you subscribed through the Android app, Google manages your payment:

### On Android Device

1. Open the **Google Play Store** app

2. Tap your **profile icon** in the top right

3. Tap **"Payments & subscriptions"**

4. Tap **"Payment methods"**

5. Tap **"Add payment method"** or edit an existing one

6. Enter your new card details

7. Save changes

### Via Web

1. Go to [pay.google.com](https://pay.google.com)

2. Sign in with your Google account

3. Click **"Payment methods"**

4. Add or update your card

Your updated payment method applies to all Google Play subscriptions.

## When to Update Your Payment Method

Update your card proactively if:

- **Your card is expiring soon** - Update before your renewal date to avoid service interruption
- **You got a new card** - Even with the same number, new expiration dates or CVCs need updating
- **Your card was lost/stolen** - Update immediately after getting your replacement
- **You want to use a different card** - Switch anytime

## What Happens If Payment Fails

If your card is declined on renewal:

1. **We'll retry** - Payment is attempted again over several days
2. **You'll get an email** - We notify you of the failed payment
3. **You'll have a grace period** - Pro access typically continues briefly while we retry
4. **Eventually access pauses** - If payment continues to fail, your account downgrades to Free

To prevent interruption:
- Update your payment method as soon as you know your card is changing
- Make sure your card has sufficient funds/credit
- Check that the billing address matches your card

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I be charged immediately when I update my card?

No. Updating your card just changes the payment method for future charges. You'll be charged at your next regular renewal date.

### Can I switch from App Store billing to direct billing (or vice versa)?

Not directly. You would need to cancel your current subscription, wait for it to end, then resubscribe using the other method. Generally, we recommend keeping your current billing method.

### What cards do you accept?

For web subscriptions: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. For App Store/Play Store: Whatever payment methods Apple/Google accept in your region.

### Can I pay with PayPal or bank transfer?

Currently, we only accept credit/debit cards for web subscriptions. App Store and Play Store subscriptions support whatever payment methods Apple and Google offer.

### My company is paying—can I use a corporate card?

Yes, you can use any valid credit card including corporate cards. For formal invoicing or purchase orders, [contact our sales team](/support/contact).
