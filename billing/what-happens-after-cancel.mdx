# What Happens When I Cancel?

Thinking about canceling or already canceled? Here's exactly what to expect—when it happens, what you keep, what you lose, and how to come back if you change your mind.

## The Short Version

- **Your data is never deleted.** Watchlists, portfolios, chat history—all safe.
- **You keep Pro access** until your current billing period ends.
- **Then you move to the Free tier** with limited features but the same account.
- **You can resubscribe anytime** to get Pro back instantly.

## Timeline: What Happens When

### When You Click "Cancel"

**Immediately:**
- You receive a confirmation email
- Your subscription is flagged to not renew
- No refund is issued (you've paid for the current period)
- Nothing else changes yet

**Your status in Settings will show:** "Pro (Cancels on [date])"

### Until Your Billing Period Ends

This could be days or weeks, depending on when you cancel.

**You still have full Pro access:**
- Unlimited AI queries
- Real-time market data
- Deep Research Mode
- Unlimited watchlists and alerts
- Multiple portfolios
- Advanced analytics
- All other Pro features

Use them while you have them!

### On Your Renewal Date

This is when your Pro access actually ends.

**Your account converts to Free tier:**
- AI queries become limited (weekly cap)
- Data switches to 15-minute delayed
- Deep Research Mode disabled
- Watchlists limited to 3 (existing ones remain, but you can't add more)
- Alerts limited to 5 (existing ones remain, but you can't add more)
- Portfolio limited to 1 (you choose which to keep active)
- Advanced analytics disabled
- Export disabled

**You'll receive an email** reminding you that your Pro access has ended.

## What Happens to Your Data

### Data That's Preserved Forever

| Data Type | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Watchlists** | All kept. If you have more than 3, you can view them but can't add new ones until under the limit. |
| **Price alerts** | All kept. If you have more than 5, they remain active but you can't add new ones. |
| **Portfolios** | All kept. If you have multiple, you choose which one to keep active on Free. |
| **Chat history** | All preserved. You can still view past conversations. |
| **Account settings** | All preserved. |
| **Connected brokerages** | Stay connected. |

**Nothing is deleted when you cancel.** We keep your data so everything is there if you return.

### Data Limitations on Free Tier

You don't lose data, but you may lose access to some of it:

**Watchlists:** If you have 6 watchlists, you keep all 6 but can't create a 7th until you delete some or upgrade.

**Alerts:** If you have 20 alerts, they all stay active. But if you delete one, you can't go back above 5 unless you upgrade.

**Portfolios:** You'll need to select one portfolio as your "active" portfolio. Others are stored but not displayed or analyzed until you upgrade again.

## What You Lose Access To

| Pro Feature | On Free Tier |
|-------------|--------------|
| Unlimited AI queries | Limited weekly queries |
| Real-time data | 15-minute delayed |
| Deep Research Mode | Not available |
| Unlimited watchlists | Up to 3 |
| Unlimited alerts | Up to 5 |
| Multiple portfolios | 1 active portfolio |
| Advanced portfolio analytics | Basic analytics |
| Full AI Arena access | View only |
| Data export | Not available |
| Priority support | Standard support |

## Cancellation Didn't Work?

If you canceled but are still being charged:

1. **Check which platform you subscribed through**
   - Web: Check Settings → Subscription for card details
   - iOS: Cancel must be done through Apple Settings
   - Android: Cancel must be done through Google Play

2. **Verify cancellation was confirmed**
   - Look for confirmation email
   - Check Settings → Subscription for "Cancels on" status

3. **Check for multiple accounts**
   - You might have subscriptions on different accounts

If you were incorrectly charged after canceling:
[Contact support →](/support/contact)

We'll investigate and refund any erroneous charges.

## Deleting Your Account vs. Canceling

**Canceling** ends your paid subscription but keeps your account and data.

**Deleting your account** permanently removes everything—your account, data, history, all of it.

If you want to delete your account entirely (not just cancel):

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Cancel first and make sure that's what you actually want.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I get a refund for unused time?

Canceling stops future charges but doesn't refund the current period. If you're within 14 days of a new subscription, you may request a refund. [Refund policy →](/billing/refund-policy)

### Can I cancel and get a prorated refund?

We don't offer prorated refunds. You keep access until your paid period ends, then convert to Free.

### Will I lose my streak or history in AI Arena?

Your AI Arena following and history is preserved. On Free tier, you can still view Arena results but won't have full access to detailed model reasoning.

### If I resubscribe, do I get a trial again?

Free trials are typically for first-time subscribers. If you've had Pro before, you generally won't get another trial, though promotional offers may occasionally be available.

### How long do you keep my data after I cancel?

Indefinitely. Your data remains until you delete your account. There's no expiration.
