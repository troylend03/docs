# Data Coverage & Limitations

This article provides a clear picture of what data Rallies covers and what we don't. Understanding these boundaries helps you use Rallies effectively and know when to seek additional sources.

## Coverage Philosophy

We prioritize:
- **Depth over breadth** — Comprehensive data for what we cover, rather than thin data everywhere
- **US markets first** — Our strongest coverage is US equities
- **Actionable data** — Information investors actually use to make decisions
- **Transparency** — Clear communication about gaps and limitations

This approach means some asset classes and regions have limited or no coverage. We'd rather be excellent at what we do cover than mediocre across everything.

## Market Coverage

### What We Cover Well

**US Stocks** — Rallies has comprehensive coverage of US equities across NYSE, NASDAQ, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, and BATS/CBOE. This includes common stocks, preferred stocks, ADRs, REITs, BDCs, and SPACs.

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** — Full coverage of US-listed ETFs including index, sector, bond, commodity, leveraged, inverse, and active ETFs.

**Data Types Covered** — For US stocks and ETFs, we provide real-time and historical prices, trading volume, financial statements, analyst ratings, earnings estimates, insider transactions, institutional ownership, dividend information, company fundamentals, and news.

### Limited Coverage

| Region/Type | Coverage Status |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Major ADRs | Good — companies like Toyota, Alibaba, etc. |
| Canadian stocks | Limited — major TSX listings only |
| European stocks | Limited — largest companies only |
| Asian stocks | Limited — primarily via ADRs |
| Emerging markets | Minimal |
| OTCQX | Partial — major names |
| OTCQB / Pink Sheets | Minimal to none |

For international and OTC stocks, expect limited financial data, sparse analyst coverage, and potentially missing insider/institutional information.

### What We Don't Cover

| Asset Class | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Options | Not covered |
| Futures | Not covered |
| Forex/Currencies | Not covered |
| Cryptocurrencies | Not covered |
| Commodities | Not covered (except via ETFs) |
| Bonds | Not covered (except via ETFs) |
| Mutual Funds | Limited coverage |
| Private Companies | Not covered |

## Data Type Limitations

### Price Data

**Included:** Open, high, low, close prices; trading volume; historical data; adjusted prices for splits and dividends.

**Not included:** Pre-market/after-hours (limited); Level 2/order book data; tick data; dark pool data.

### Financial Statements

**Included:** Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements; quarterly and annual data; multiple years of history.

**Limitations:** We show standardized figures (may differ from exact filing formats); historical data changes with restatements; limited non-GAAP metrics; data appears after SEC filing, not at earnings announcement.

### Analyst Data

**Included:** Consensus ratings, price targets, EPS and revenue estimates, rating changes.

**Limitations:** Coverage varies dramatically by company size; no full research reports; limited historical estimates; ratings may lag publication by hours to days.

### Insider & Institutional Data

**Insider transactions:** Available within 24 hours of SEC Form 4 filing (1-3 days after actual transaction). Cannot distinguish pre-planned 10b5-1 sales from discretionary trades.

**Institutional ownership:** 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end, so data is always retrospective. Only institutions managing $100M+ must file. Short and derivative positions may not be fully represented.

### Dividends & News

**Dividends:** Amounts, yields, dates, and history included. Special dividends may not be separately categorized; we don't forecast future dividends.

**News:** Headlines from major sources and press releases included. We don't track social media, message boards, or provide sentiment scoring.

## Coverage by Company Size

| Company Size | Typical Coverage |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Mega-cap** ($200B+) | Excellent — full data, many analysts |
| **Large-cap** ($10B-$200B) | Very good — comprehensive data |
| **Mid-cap** ($2B-$10B) | Good — most data, moderate analyst coverage |
| **Small-cap** ($300M-$2B) | Fair — basic data, limited analysts |
| **Micro-cap** ($50M-$300M) | Limited — price and basic fundamentals |
| **Nano-cap** (<$50M) | Minimal — may have only price data |

## What This Means for You

**For Research:** Large, well-known companies have comprehensive data. Smaller and international companies may require supplemental sources.

**For the AI Assistant:** The AI's knowledge reflects our data coverage. It will indicate when data is limited or unavailable.

**For Screeners:** Work best with well-covered US stocks. Many filters may exclude stocks with incomplete data.

## Verifying Coverage Gaps

If data seems missing:
1. Check the ticker — ensure you're looking at the right security
2. Consider the company — small or foreign companies have limited coverage
3. Use primary sources — SEC EDGAR and company IR sites for verification

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why don't you cover options?

Options require specialized pricing models and data feeds. We're focused on equity research. Options coverage may be considered in the future.

### Can I track my crypto portfolio in Rallies?

Not currently. Rallies focuses on traditional securities.

### Why is analyst coverage limited for small caps?

Sell-side analysts typically cover stocks with sufficient trading volume and investor interest. Small caps often lack this coverage industry-wide.

### What about international stocks I own?

ADRs trading on US exchanges have good coverage. Foreign-listed shares have limited coverage — your brokerage is the best source for positions you hold.

### Will coverage expand in the future?

Yes. We regularly evaluate and expand coverage based on user needs and data availability. Sign up for product updates to learn about new coverage when it launches.

### Why does data availability vary so much by company size?

This reflects the financial data industry as a whole. Larger companies attract more analyst attention, have more institutional ownership (and thus 13F filings), generate more news coverage, and are more actively traded. Smaller companies simply have less data available from any source.
