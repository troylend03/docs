# About Our Data Sources

### Known Limitations

Despite our efforts, be aware:

- **Data can have errors** — No data provider is perfect
- **Timing gaps exist** — There's always some delay between events and data
- **Coverage varies** — Small caps and international stocks have less data
- **Estimates are estimates** — Analyst projections are opinions, not facts
- **Historical data changes** — Companies restate financials; we update accordingly

## AI and Data

### How the AI Uses Data

The AI Research Assistant pulls from our data sources to answer your questions. When you ask about a stock:

1. AI identifies what data is relevant
2. Retrieves current information from our databases
3. Synthesizes and explains it in natural language

### AI Data Limitations

The AI's knowledge is only as good as our data:
- If data is delayed, AI answers reflect that delay
- If coverage is limited, AI will indicate that
- AI may occasionally misinterpret or miscalculate—always verify important decisions

[Understanding AI limitations →](/ai-assistant/limitations)

## Verifying Data

For important decisions, we recommend verifying with primary sources:

### SEC EDGAR
[sec.gov/edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)
Official source for all SEC filings—financials, insider trades, institutional holdings

### Company Investor Relations
Most public companies have an IR website with earnings releases, presentations, and filings

### Your Brokerage
For real-time prices and your account data, your brokerage is the authoritative source

## Reporting Data Issues

If you spot data that seems wrong:

1. **Double-check the source** — Verify against SEC or company IR
2. **Consider timing** — Data might not have updated yet
3. **Report to us** — [Contact support](/support/contact) with:
   - The ticker symbol
   - What data point seems wrong
   - What you believe the correct value is
   - Your source for the correct value

We investigate all reported discrepancies and correct confirmed errors.

## Data We Don't Have

To set expectations, here's what we don't provide:

- **Pre-market/after-hours prices** — Limited display of extended hours data
- **Level 2 quotes** — We show best bid/ask, not full order book
- **Options data** — Limited options coverage
- **Futures/commodities** — Not currently covered
- **Forex** — Not currently covered
- **Crypto** — Not currently covered
- **Private company data** — Only public companies
- **Real-time news sentiment** — News is shown but not scored in real-time
