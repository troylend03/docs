# Data Freshness & Update Frequency

Different types of financial data update at different frequencies. Understanding these update cycles helps you interpret data correctly and know when to expect new information.

## Quick Reference

| Data Type | Update Frequency | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Stock prices (Pro) | Real-time | During market hours |
| Stock prices (Free) | 15-minute delay | During market hours |
| Trading volume | Real-time | During market hours |
| Financial statements | Quarterly | After SEC filing |
| Analyst ratings | As published | Varies by analyst |
| Earnings estimates | Ongoing | Updated as analysts revise |
| Insider transactions | 1-2 days | After SEC Form 4 filing |
| Institutional ownership | Quarterly | 45-day filing delay |
| Dividends | As announced | When declared by company |
| News | Continuous | As stories are published |
| Company information | Periodic | When changes occur |

## Price Data Updates

### Real-Time Prices (Pro Users)

Pro subscribers receive continuous price updates during regular trading hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday excluding holidays). This includes last trade price, bid/ask prices, trading volume, and day's high/low.

Pre-market and after-hours data has limited visibility and may be delayed.

### Delayed Prices (Free Users)

Free users see prices with a 15-minute delay during market hours. Once the market closes, the final closing price is available without delay.

### Historical Prices

Available immediately for completed trading days, adjusted for splits and dividends. Generally available by evening of trade date.

## Financial Statement Updates

### Filing Timelines

**Quarterly reports (10-Q):** Filed 40-45 days after quarter end, depending on company size.

**Annual reports (10-K):** Filed 60-90 days after fiscal year end, depending on company size.

**Rallies update timing:** Data available within 24-48 hours of SEC filing.

### Important Distinction

| Event | When | What You Get |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Earnings announcement | Press release | Headlines, key numbers |
| Earnings call | Same day | Context, guidance |
| SEC filing (10-Q/10-K) | Days to weeks later | Full financial statements |

Rallies financial statement data comes from SEC filings, not earnings announcements. Expect a gap between when earnings are announced and when detailed financials appear.

## Analyst Data Updates

**Ratings and price targets:** Update as analysts publish. Major companies see multiple updates per week; small caps may see rare updates.

**Consensus estimates:** Rolling updates as individual analysts revise. EPS and revenue estimates recalculated automatically.

**Lag in our system:** Usually same-day for major data providers; may take 1-2 days for all sources to sync.

## Insider Transaction Updates

Insiders must file SEC Form 4 within 2 business days of a transaction. Rallies displays this data within 24 hours of filing.

**Example timeline:**
| Day | Event |
|-----|-------|
| Monday | CEO sells 10,000 shares |
| Wednesday | Form 4 filed with SEC |
| Thursday | Transaction appears in Rallies |

You're always seeing transactions after the fact — no way to know about them until filed.

## Institutional Ownership Updates

13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end:

| Quarter End | Filing Deadline | Data Available |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| March 31 | May 15 | Mid-May |
| June 30 | August 14 | Mid-August |
| September 30 | November 14 | Mid-November |
| December 31 | February 14 | Mid-February |

This data is always retrospective. When you see Q4 data in February, it shows holdings as of December 31 — positions may have changed significantly since then.

## Dividend & News Updates

**Dividends:** Information appears within 24 hours of company announcement. Dividend yield updates continuously as stock prices change.

**News:** Updates continuously as stories are published. SEC filings appear within minutes; press releases within minutes to hours. We don't track social media or message boards.

## Why Data Might Seem Stale

### Normal Delays

| Situation | Expected? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Financials don't match earnings announcement | Yes — wait for SEC filing |
| Institutional holdings seem old | Yes — quarterly with 45-day lag |
| No recent analyst updates for small cap | Yes — limited coverage |
| Price unchanged outside market hours | Yes — market is closed |

### Potential Issues

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Price stuck during market hours | Refresh, check connectivity |
| Filing is weeks old but data not updated | Report to support |
| Obvious data error | Report to support |

## Free vs. Pro Differences

| Data Type | Free | Pro |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Price quotes | 15-minute delay | Real-time |
| All other data | Same | Same |

The primary difference is price quote speed. Fundamental data updates identically for both tiers.

## Setting Expectations

**What you can rely on:**
- Real-time prices (Pro) during market hours
- Financial data within 48 hours of SEC filing
- Insider transactions within 24 hours of Form 4 filing
- Dividend announcements within 24 hours

**What takes time:**
- Institutional holdings — always 45+ days old
- Small cap analyst coverage — unpredictable timing
- International data — may lag US data

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my price 15 minutes old?

You're likely on the Free plan, which includes a 15-minute price delay. Upgrade to Pro for real-time prices.

### When will quarterly financials be updated?

Financials update after the company files with the SEC, not when they announce earnings. This can be days to weeks after the earnings call.

### Why does institutional ownership seem outdated?

13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end, so institutional data is always at least 6-7 weeks old. This is an SEC filing requirement, not a Rallies limitation.

### How quickly do analyst rating changes appear?

Usually same-day, but can take up to 1-2 days depending on the data source.

### Do prices update after hours?

Limited pre-market and after-hours data is available, depending on your plan and the stock's extended-hours volume.
