# Your First 5 Minutes: Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Rallies! This guide walks you through the essentials so you can start researching smarter right away. In about 5 minutes, you'll ask your first AI question, create a watchlist, and see how portfolio tracking works.

## Step 1: Ask Your First Question (1 minute)

The AI Research Assistant is the heart of Rallies. Let's try it.

1. **Click "Chat"** in the left sidebar (or tap the chat icon on mobile)

2. **Type a question** about any stock, market, or investing topic. Try one of these:
   - "What should I know about Apple?"
   - "Explain what P/E ratio means"
   - "What are the risks of investing in Tesla?"

3. **Press Enter** and watch the AI research for you

4. **Ask a follow-up** - The AI remembers context, so you can ask things like "How does that compare to Microsoft?" without repeating yourself.

> 💡 **Tip:** Be specific for better answers. "What are Nvidia's profit margins over the last 3 years?" beats "Tell me about Nvidia."

## Step 2: Create a Watchlist (1 minute)

Track stocks you're interested in without buying them yet.

1. **Click "Watchlists"** in the left sidebar

2. **Click "+ New Watchlist"**

3. **Name it** something meaningful (e.g., "Tech Stocks to Research" or "Dividend Ideas")

4. **Add stocks** by typing a ticker symbol or company name in the search box

5. **View your watchlist** anytime to see price changes, news, and more

You can create multiple watchlists to organize different themes, strategies, or ideas.

## Step 3: Explore a Stock Page (1 minute)

Get detailed information on any company.

1. **Search for a stock** using the search bar at the top (try "AAPL" or "Apple")

2. **Click the result** to open the stock page

3. **Browse the sections:**
   - **Overview** - Key stats, price, and company description
   - **Financials** - Revenue, earnings, margins, and more
   - **Analysis** - Analyst ratings and price targets
   - **News** - Recent headlines and SEC filings
   - **Ownership** - Insider trades and institutional holdings

4. **Ask the AI** about this stock by clicking the chat icon - context is pre-loaded so you can ask things like "What are the main risks?" directly.

## Step 4: Connect Your Portfolio (2 minutes, optional)

See your real investments analyzed by AI.

1. **Click "Portfolio"** in the left sidebar

2. **Choose how to add holdings:**
   - **Connect a brokerage** - Automatically sync your positions (we use Plaid for secure connections)
   - **Add manually** - Enter ticker symbols and number of shares yourself

3. **If connecting a brokerage:**
   - Click "Connect Account"
   - Search for your broker (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, etc.)
   - Log in through the secure Plaid window
   - Select which accounts to link

4. **Once connected,** you'll see:
   - Your total portfolio value
   - Today's gain/loss
   - Individual position performance
   - Allocation breakdown

5. **Ask the AI about your portfolio** - Try "What are my biggest risks?" or "Am I too concentrated in any sector?"

> 🔒 **Your data is secure.** We use Plaid, the same service used by Venmo and most banking apps. We can see your holdings but never your login credentials or ability to make trades. [Learn more about security →](/portfolio/security)
