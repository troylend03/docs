# Verifying Your Email

When you create a Rallies account with your email address, we send a verification link to confirm it's really you. This keeps your account secure and ensures you receive important notifications.

> 💡 **Signed up with Google or Apple?** You don't need to verify your email—your account is already confirmed through your social login.

## How to Verify Your Email

1. **Check your inbox** for an email from Rallies.ai with the subject "Verify your email address"

2. **Open the email** and click the **"Verify Email"** button

3. **You're verified!** You'll be redirected to Rallies and can start using all features.

The verification link is valid for 24 hours. If it expires, you can request a new one.

## Resend the Verification Email

If you didn't receive the email or the link expired:

### On Web

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai) and sign in with your email and password
2. You'll see a banner saying "Please verify your email"
3. Click **"Resend verification email"**
4. Check your inbox (and spam folder)

### On Mobile

1. Open the Rallies app and sign in
2. Tap the verification reminder banner
3. Tap **"Resend Email"**
4. Check your inbox

## Didn't Receive the Email?

If the verification email isn't in your inbox after a few minutes, try these steps:

### 1. Check Your Spam or Junk Folder

Verification emails sometimes get filtered. Look in:
- Spam
- Junk
- Promotions (Gmail)
- Other/Focused (Outlook)

If you find it there, mark it as "Not Spam" so future Rallies emails reach your inbox.

### 2. Check the Email Address

Make sure you signed up with the correct email. Common issues:
- Typos (gamil.com instead of gmail.com)
- Wrong domain (.com vs .net)
- Using a different email than intended

To check which email your account uses, try signing in—the login error message will confirm if the email exists in our system.

### 3. Add Rallies to Your Contacts

Add **hello@rallies.ai** to your email contacts or address book. This helps prevent future emails from being filtered.

### 4. Check Email Filters

If you have custom email rules or filters, make sure they're not automatically moving or deleting emails from rallies.ai.

### 5. Wait a Few Minutes

Sometimes email delivery takes up to 10 minutes, especially with certain email providers. If you just requested a resend, give it a bit of time.

### 6. Try a Different Email

If you consistently can't receive emails at your current address, you may need to create a new account with a different email, or sign up using Google or Apple instead.

## Corporate or School Email Issues

Some corporate and educational email systems have strict spam filters that may block emails from new senders.

**Try these solutions:**

- Ask your IT department to whitelist emails from @rallies.ai
- Use a personal email address (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) instead
- Sign up with Google or Apple to bypass email verification entirely

## Verification Link Expired

Verification links expire after 24 hours for security reasons. If your link has expired:

1. Go to [rallies.ai](https://rallies.ai)
2. Sign in with your email and password
3. Click **"Resend verification email"** on the banner
4. A fresh verification link will be sent to your inbox

## Why We Require Email Verification

Email verification helps us:

- **Confirm your identity** - Ensures the account belongs to you
- **Protect your account** - Prevents unauthorized signups using your email
- **Deliver important notifications** - Password resets, alerts, and security notices go to a verified address
- **Enable account recovery** - If you ever lose access, we can help you recover it through your verified email
