# What is Rallies.ai?

Rallies.ai is an AI-powered investment research platform that helps you research stocks, analyze your portfolio, and learn about investing—all through natural conversation with our AI Research Assistant.

## What Rallies Does

### AI Research Assistant

Ask questions in plain English and get detailed, data-driven answers about any stock, sector, or investing topic. The AI analyzes real-time market data, financial statements, analyst reports, and more to give you comprehensive research insights.

**Example questions you might ask:**

- "What's the bull and bear case for Tesla?"
- "Compare Apple and Microsoft's profit margins over the last 5 years"
- "Explain why semiconductor stocks have been volatile"
- "What are the key metrics I should look at for dividend stocks?"

### Stock Analysis Tools

Access detailed information on thousands of stocks including financial statements and key metrics, technical indicators and charts, analyst ratings and price targets, earnings history and upcoming reports, insider trading and institutional holdings, and news and SEC filings.

### Vibe Screener

Find stocks using natural language instead of complicated filters. Just describe what you're looking for—"undervalued tech stocks with strong cash flow" or "dividend stocks that have increased payouts for 10+ years"—and the screener finds matches.

### Watchlists & Alerts

Track the stocks you care about and get notified when something important happens. Create unlimited watchlists, set price alerts, receive earnings notifications, and monitor everything in one place.

### Portfolio Tracking

Connect your brokerage accounts or manually add holdings to see your portfolio performance at a glance, understand your allocation and diversification, get AI-powered insights on your holdings, and track gains, losses, and cost basis.

### AI Arena

Watch AI models compete in a stock-picking competition using simulated trades. See how different AI approaches perform, follow a model's reasoning, and learn from their strategies—all for educational purposes with no real money involved.
