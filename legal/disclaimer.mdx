# Important Disclaimer: We Are Not Investment Advisors

This page explains what Rallies.ai is, what we provide, and—importantly—what we do not provide. Please read this carefully before using our platform.

## What Rallies.ai Is

Rallies.ai is an **investment research and educational platform**. We provide tools, data, and AI-powered analysis to help you learn about investing and conduct your own research.

Our platform is designed to make financial information more accessible and help you become a more informed investor. Think of Rallies as a research assistant that helps you gather and understand information—not as an advisor who tells you what to do.

## What We Are NOT

**Rallies.ai is NOT a registered investment advisor (RIA), broker-dealer, or financial planner.**

We are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any state securities regulatory authority as an investment advisor. We do not provide personalized investment advice, and no fiduciary relationship exists between Rallies and our users.

## What We Provide vs. What We Don't

| We Provide | We Do NOT Provide |
|------------|-------------------|
| Investment research and analysis | Personalized investment recommendations |
| Educational content about investing | Buy, sell, or hold advice |
| Financial data and metrics | Financial planning services |
| AI-powered insights based on public data | Tax advice |
| Tools to support your own research | Legal advice |
| General information about securities | Advice tailored to your specific situation |

## Why the AI Cannot Give You Buy/Sell Recommendations

You may notice that when you ask the AI questions like "Should I buy this stock?" or "Is this a good investment for me?", it won't give you a direct recommendation. This is intentional and required by law.

Providing personalized investment advice—recommendations tailored to your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance—requires registration as an investment advisor with the SEC or state regulators. Registered advisors have fiduciary duties, compliance requirements, and regulatory oversight.

Rallies is not registered as an investment advisor, so we cannot legally provide this type of personalized advice. More importantly, even the most sophisticated AI cannot know your complete financial picture: your income, debts, other assets, tax situation, time horizon, risk tolerance, or personal goals.

**What the AI can do:**

- Present data and analysis on securities
- Explain investing concepts and strategies
- Show you what metrics other investors might consider
- Help you understand financial statements and ratios
- Summarize analyst opinions and market sentiment
- Compare companies on various factors

**What the AI will not do:**

- Tell you to buy, sell, or hold any security
- Recommend specific investments for your portfolio
- Provide advice based on your personal situation
- Make predictions about future stock prices
- Guarantee any investment outcomes

## Your Responsibility

By using Rallies.ai, you acknowledge that:

1. **You make your own investment decisions.** Any actions you take based on information from Rallies are your own responsibility.

2. **You should consult professionals.** We strongly recommend consulting with a qualified financial advisor, tax professional, or legal counsel before making investment decisions.

3. **Past performance doesn't predict future results.** Historical data, backtests, and past returns shown on Rallies do not guarantee future performance.

4. **Investing involves risk.** You can lose money investing in securities. Never invest money you cannot afford to lose.

5. **Information may not be complete or current.** While we strive for accuracy, financial data can contain errors, delays, or omissions.

## About AI Arena

The AI Arena feature shows AI models competing in a stock-picking competition using **simulated trades with fake money**. This is an educational demonstration only.

The trades and portfolio decisions shown in AI Arena are NOT investment recommendations. AI model performance in this arena does not predict future results and should not be used as a basis for making investment decisions.

## About Portfolio Insights

When you connect your brokerage account or enter holdings manually, the AI can provide analysis of your portfolio. This analysis is general in nature and based solely on the data you've provided.

Portfolio insights from Rallies:

- Are for informational and educational purposes only
- Do not constitute personalized investment advice
- Do not take into account your full financial situation
- Should not be the sole basis for any investment decision

- Is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind
- May contain errors, inaccuracies, or omissions
- May be delayed (see our [data freshness documentation](/data/update-frequency))
- Is sourced from third-party providers and public filings

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't the AI just tell me what to buy?

Providing personalized investment recommendations requires registration as an investment advisor with regulatory bodies like the SEC. Rallies is a research platform, not a registered advisor. Beyond the legal requirements, no AI can know your complete financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance—factors that are essential for personalized advice.

### Is the information on Rallies accurate?

We source data from reputable financial data providers and work to maintain accuracy. However, financial data can contain errors or delays, and we cannot guarantee completeness or timeliness. Always verify important information independently and consult professionals before making investment decisions.

### Should I use Rallies instead of a financial advisor?

No. Rallies is a research tool to help you learn and gather information. It does not replace the personalized guidance of a qualified financial advisor who understands your complete financial situation. We recommend working with a professional for significant financial decisions.
