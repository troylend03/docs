# Mobile App Troubleshooting

Having trouble with the Rallies mobile app? This guide covers the most common issues and how to resolve them.

## Quick Fixes to Try First

Before diving into specific issues:

1. **Force close and reopen the app** - Swipe the app away and launch fresh
2. **Check your internet connection** - Try loading a website to confirm connectivity
3. **Update the app** - Make sure you're running the latest version
4. **Restart your phone** - Solves more problems than you'd expect
5. **Check Rallies status** - Visit [status.rallies.ai](https://status.rallies.ai) for outages

## App Crashes or Won't Open

### App crashes immediately

**iOS:**
1. Force close: Swipe up from the bottom, swipe Rallies away
2. Restart your iPhone
3. If it still crashes, delete and reinstall the app
4. Make sure iOS is updated to at least version 15.0

**Android:**
1. Force stop: Settings > Apps > Rallies > Force Stop
2. Clear cache: Settings > Apps > Rallies > Storage > Clear Cache
3. Restart your phone
4. If it persists, clear app data (you'll need to sign in again)
5. Reinstall if nothing else works

### App freezes on a specific screen

1. Wait 30 seconds - it might be loading data
2. Force close and reopen
3. If it happens repeatedly on the same screen, clear app cache
4. Report the issue to support with the screen name

## Login and Authentication Issues

### Can't sign in with email/password

1. Verify your credentials work on the web version first
2. Check for typos - passwords are case-sensitive
3. Try "Forgot Password" to reset
4. Make sure you're using the right sign-in method (email vs. Google/Apple)

### Google or Apple sign-in not working

**Apple sign-in (iOS):**
- Make sure you're signed into your Apple ID in device settings
- Try signing out and back into your Apple ID

**Google sign-in:**
- Ensure you're signed into Google on your device
- Check that pop-ups aren't being blocked

### Biometric login stopped working

1. Ensure biometrics are set up in your phone's settings
2. In Rallies: Settings > Security > disable and re-enable biometric login
3. If Face ID fails repeatedly, re-enroll your face in iPhone Settings

- On Android, check battery saver isn't restricting background activity

### Price alerts not triggering

1. Verify the alert is set correctly (price target and direction)
2. Make sure notifications are enabled
3. Check if the stock actually hit your target price

## Data Sync Issues

### Watchlists not syncing between devices

2. For connected brokerages, tap the refresh icon
3. If positions are wrong, try reconnecting your brokerage

### AI conversations not appearing

1. Pull down on the Chat screen to refresh
2. Older conversations may be archived - check conversation history
3. Sign out and back in if conversations are missing

## Performance Issues

### App running slowly

1. Close other apps running in the background
2. Restart your phone
3. Clear the app cache
4. Start fresh AI conversations (long ones slow performance)

### High battery drain

**Reduce battery usage:**
1. Reduce background refresh frequency in Settings > Data
2. Remove or reduce widgets
3. Close the app when not using it

### Charts not loading

1. Check your internet connection
2. Pull down to refresh the stock page

4. Clear app cache if charts are persistently broken

## Platform-Specific Issues

### iOS-Specific

**Widgets not updating:**
- Check that Background App Refresh is enabled
- Remove and re-add the widget
- Make sure Low Power Mode isn't active

### Android-Specific

**App killed in background:**

Some Android manufacturers aggressively kill background apps.

1. Settings > Apps > Rallies > Battery
2. Select "Unrestricted" or "No restrictions"
3. On Samsung: disable "Put app to sleep"
4. On Xiaomi: enable "Autostart" for Rallies

**Notifications silent:**
1. Check notification channel settings individually
2. Disable battery optimization for Rallies

## Error Messages

### "Network error" or "Connection failed"

1. Check that you have internet access
2. Switch between WiFi and cellular
3. Disable VPN if using one
4. Try again in a few minutes

### "Rate limit exceeded"

- Free accounts have limits on AI queries
- Wait until your limit resets (weekly for Free)
- Consider upgrading to Pro for unlimited queries

## Reinstalling the App

If nothing else works, a clean reinstall often solves persistent issues.

**Before reinstalling:**
- Make sure you know your login credentials
