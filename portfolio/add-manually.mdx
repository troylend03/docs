# Adding Holdings Manually

Don't want to connect your brokerage? You can manually enter your holdings to track your portfolio in Rallies. This guide shows you how to add, edit, and manage manually entered positions.

## When to Use Manual Entry

Manual entry is useful when:

- You prefer not to connect your brokerage
- Your brokerage isn't supported for automatic sync
- You want to track a hypothetical or model portfolio
- You need to add positions from multiple sources
- You want to supplement connected accounts with additional holdings

## Add a Holding on Web

1. Go to **Portfolio** in the left sidebar

2. Click **"Add Manually"** or **"+ Add Holding"**

3. **Search for the stock**
   - Type a ticker symbol (AAPL) or company name (Apple)
   - Select from the dropdown

4. **Enter the details:**

   | Field | What to Enter |
   |-------|---------------|
   | **Shares** | Number of shares you own (e.g., 50) |
   | **Cost per share** | Price you paid per share (e.g., $150.00) |
   | **Purchase date** | When you bought (optional but helpful) |

5. Click **"Add"** or **"Save"**

6. The holding appears in your portfolio immediately

### Adding Multiple Lots

If you bought the same stock at different times/prices:

**Option 1:** Enter total shares with average cost
- Shares: 100
- Cost: Your average price across all purchases

**Option 2:** Add multiple entries for the same stock
- Entry 1: 50 shares at $100
- Entry 2: 50 shares at $120
- Portfolio will show combined position with blended cost basis

## Add a Holding on Mobile

### iOS

1. Open Portfolio
2. Tap **"+"** or **"Add Holding"**
3. Search for the stock
4. Enter shares and cost per share
5. Tap **"Add"**

### Android

1. Open Portfolio
2. Tap the **"+"** floating button
3. Search and select the stock
4. Fill in shares and cost
5. Tap **"Save"**

## What to Enter for Each Field

### Shares (Required)

The number of shares you own.
- Whole numbers: 100
- Fractional shares: 10.5 (if your broker supports fractional shares)

### Cost Per Share (Recommended)

What you paid per share, on average.

**Why it matters:**
- Enables gain/loss calculations
- Shows your return percentage
- Essential for performance tracking

**If you don't know exact cost:**
- Estimate based on when you bought
- Use your broker statement
- Enter $0 if unknown (performance won't calculate)

### Purchase Date (Optional)

When you bought the shares.

**Why it helps:**
- Provides context for holding period
- Useful for tax considerations (short vs. long-term)
- Helps track when you entered positions

## Editing Manual Holdings

### Change Shares or Cost Basis

1. Go to Portfolio
2. Find the holding you want to edit
3. Click/tap the **three-dot menu** (⋮) or **"Edit"**
4. Update the shares, cost, or date
5. Save changes

### When to Edit

Edit your holdings when:
- You buy more shares (increase share count, adjust average cost)
- You sell some shares (decrease share count)
- You realize your cost basis was wrong
- You need to correct a data entry error

### Calculating New Average Cost

If you're adding to a position:

> New Average Cost = (Old Shares × Old Cost + New Shares × New Cost) / Total Shares

**Example:**
- Owned: 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
- Bought: 50 shares at $60 = $3,000
- New total: 150 shares, $8,000 invested
- New average: $8,000 / 150 = $53.33 per share

## Removing Manual Holdings

### Delete a Position

1. Go to Portfolio
2. Find the holding
3. Click/tap **three-dot menu** (⋮) → **"Remove"** or **"Delete"**
4. Confirm removal

### When You Sell

When you sell shares:
- **Sell all:** Remove the entire position
- **Sell some:** Edit to reduce share count

> **Note:** Rallies doesn't track realized gains separately. When you remove a position, the gain/loss is no longer shown. Consider keeping a separate record for tax purposes.

## Manual + Connected Accounts

You can use both manual entry AND connected brokerages:

**Use cases:**
- Main brokerage connected, but manually add 401(k) holdings
- Connected account plus manually tracked company stock
- Spouse's holdings added manually to see combined picture

All holdings (manual and connected) appear in one unified portfolio view.

### Avoiding Duplicates

If you connect a brokerage that has positions you already entered manually:
- You may see duplicates
- Remove the manual entries for stocks now syncing automatically
- Or keep them separate if tracking different accounts

## Tips for Manual Portfolio Tracking

### Be Accurate

The value of portfolio tracking depends on accurate data:
- Double-check share counts
- Use actual purchase prices, not estimates
- Update when you make trades

### Keep It Simple

If exact cost basis is difficult:
- Use your best estimate
- Round to reasonable numbers
- Something is better than nothing

### Update Regularly

Manual portfolios don't update automatically:
- Add new purchases promptly
- Remove sold positions
- Periodically verify accuracy against broker statements

### Consider Connecting Instead

If you have many holdings or trade frequently, connecting your brokerage saves time and ensures accuracy. [Learn about brokerage connection →](/portfolio/connect-brokerage)

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find a stock to add"

- Try the ticker symbol instead of company name
- Check spelling
- Some very small, OTC, or international stocks may not be available

### "My total value looks wrong"

- Verify share counts are correct
- Check that all positions are entered
- Make sure you didn't accidentally duplicate or omit holdings

### "Performance isn't showing"

- Cost basis is required for performance calculation
- If cost is $0 or blank, return % won't display
- Edit holdings to add cost basis

### "I accidentally deleted a holding"

- Re-add it manually
- Your deletion doesn't affect any underlying data
- Use your brokerage statement to get accurate share count and cost

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to enter every trade?

No. You just need your current holdings. Enter how many shares you own now and your average cost basis—you don't need to enter each individual trade.

### Can I track options or other securities manually?

Currently, manual entry is optimized for stocks and ETFs. Options and other complex securities may not track correctly.

### Will my data be saved if I later connect my brokerage?

Yes. Manual entries are saved. If you connect a brokerage, you may want to remove manual entries for positions now syncing automatically to avoid duplicates.

### Can I import a CSV of my holdings?

This feature may be available—check for an "Import" option in the Portfolio section. If not available, [request this feature](/support/feedback).

### Is there a limit to how many holdings I can add manually?

No limit. Add as many positions as you need.
