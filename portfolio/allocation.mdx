## Understanding Diversification

### Why Diversification Matters

- **Reduces risk** - Don't have all eggs in one basket
- **Smoother returns** - Different sectors perform at different times
- **Protection** - If one sector drops, others may hold steady

### Signs of Good Diversification
- No single stock is more than ~10-15% of portfolio
- Multiple sectors represented
- Mix of market caps
- Some geographic diversity

### Warning Signs
- One stock dominates your portfolio
- All holdings in one sector
- No international exposure
- Over-concentration in employer stock

## AI Allocation Insights

Ask the AI about your allocation:

> "How diversified is my portfolio?"
> "Am I overweight in tech?"
> "What sectors am I missing?"
> "Compare my allocation to the S&P 500"

The AI can provide personalized analysis based on your holdings.

## Rebalancing

If your allocation has drifted:

1. **Identify overweights** - Sectors above your target
2. **Identify underweights** - Sectors below your target
3. **Consider adjustments** - Buy underweights, trim overweights
4. **Tax implications** - Selling triggers capital gains

<Note>
Rallies provides allocation analysis but does not give personalized investment advice. Consider consulting a financial advisor for rebalancing decisions.
