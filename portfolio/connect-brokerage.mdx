# Connecting Your Brokerage Account

Connect your brokerage to Rallies for automatic portfolio syncing. Your holdings update automatically, so you always have an accurate view of your investments without manual entry.

## How Brokerage Connection Works

We use **Plaid**, the same secure service used by Venmo, Robinhood, and thousands of banking apps. Here's the process:

1. **You select your brokerage** — Search for your broker in our list
2. **You log in through Plaid** — A secure window connects directly to your broker
3. **Plaid verifies your identity** — Using your broker's normal login and any 2FA
4. **Rallies receives read-only access** — We can see your positions, not your credentials
5. **Your portfolio syncs** — Holdings appear in Rallies automatically

### What We Can See

✓ Your holdings and positions
✓ Number of shares owned
✓ Cost basis (if your broker provides it)
✓ Account types (brokerage, IRA, etc.)

### What We Cannot See

✗ Your login credentials (username/password)
✗ Your account numbers
✗ Your Social Security number
✗ Ability to make trades or transfers

> 🔒 **Rallies has read-only access. We can never make trades, withdraw money, or modify your accounts in any way.**

### Manual Refresh

To force an immediate sync:

1. Go to Portfolio
2. Click the **refresh icon** or **"Sync Now"**
3. Wait a few seconds for update

### Sync Delays

In some cases, there may be delays:
- New trades may take hours to appear
- Some brokers batch their data updates
- Positions in transit (transfers) may be delayed

For the most real-time data, check your actual brokerage app.

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### "My brokerage isn't listed"

- Try different name variations (e.g., "Schwab" vs "Charles Schwab")
- Your broker may use a different name for their investment accounts
- If truly not supported, use [manual entry](/portfolio/add-manually)
- [Request we add your broker →](/support/feedback)

### "Connection failed" or "Credentials incorrect"

1. Verify you can log in directly at your broker's website
2. Check if your broker is having an outage
3. Make sure you're completing any 2FA prompts
4. Try again in a few minutes
5. Some brokers block third-party connections—check your broker's security settings

### "Only some accounts are showing"

1. During connection, make sure you selected all desired accounts
2. Some account types (certain retirement accounts, 529 plans) may not sync
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting, selecting all accounts

### "Holdings are missing or incorrect"

- Syncs can take time—wait 24 hours for full accuracy
- Some complex securities (options, certain funds) may not sync correctly
- Recently purchased positions may take time to appear
- Use manual entry to add any missing positions

### "Connection keeps disconnecting"

- Your broker may require you to re-authorize periodically
- When prompted, go through the Plaid flow again to reconnect
- Some brokers have stricter third-party access policies

## Disconnecting a Brokerage

If you want to remove a connected brokerage:

1. Go to **Settings → Portfolio** or **Settings → Connected Accounts**
2. Find the brokerage you want to remove
3. Click **"Disconnect"** or **"Remove"**
4. Confirm

When you disconnect:
- The connection to your broker is severed

- No data is retained from that brokerage
- Your actual brokerage account is unaffected

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to connect my brokerage?

Yes. We use Plaid, trusted by millions of users and thousands of apps. Rallies receives read-only access—we can see your holdings but can never make trades, withdraw money, or access your credentials.

### Will connecting affect my brokerage account?

No. Your brokerage account remains exactly the same. We only read data; we never make changes.

### Can Rallies trade for me?

No. Rallies is a research and tracking platform. We have no ability to execute trades, even with a connected brokerage.

### What if my broker requires extra security (like a token or callback)?

Plaid handles most security methods. Complete any prompts during the connection process. If your broker has a unique security setup that isn't working, try connecting from their list of approved third-party apps (if available) or use manual entry.

### Can I connect international brokerages?

Currently, we primarily support US brokerages. Some international brokers may work, but coverage varies. Try connecting to see if yours is supported.

### How do I know my connection is working?

If your holdings appear and update in Rallies, the connection is working. You can also check Settings → Connected Accounts to see connection status.
