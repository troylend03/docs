# Troubleshooting Brokerage Connection

Having trouble connecting your brokerage? Here's how to diagnose and fix common connection issues.

## Common Connection Problems

### "Connection Failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect login credentials
- Two-factor authentication blocking the connection
- Brokerage is experiencing downtime
- Your brokerage isn't supported

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify your credentials** - Log into your brokerage directly to confirm
2. **Check 2FA** - Some brokerages require you to approve the connection in their app
3. **Try again later** - The brokerage may have temporary issues
4. **Check supported brokerages** - [View the list →](/portfolio/supported-brokerages)

### Connection Keeps Disconnecting

**Why it happens:**
- Password changed at brokerage
- Session expired
- Brokerage security policy
- Required re-authentication

**Solutions:**
1. Go to **Portfolio → Connected Accounts**
2. Click **"Reconnect"** or **"Refresh"**
3. Re-enter your credentials
4. Complete any 2FA prompts

### Data Not Updating

If your connection shows "Connected" but data is stale:

1. **Check last sync time** - View in Portfolio settings
2. **Force a sync** - Click "Sync Now" if available
3. **Reconnect** - Disconnect and reconnect the account
4. **Wait** - Some brokerages sync less frequently

## Brokerage-Specific Issues

### Fidelity
- Requires Fidelity-specific login (not NetBenefits)
- May require approving the connection in their app

### Charles Schwab
- Use your Schwab login, not TD Ameritrade (if applicable)
- 2FA approval often required

### Robinhood
- Must use email/password, not biometric login
- May need to approve in Robinhood app

### Vanguard
- Use your personal account login
- Workplace accounts may have restrictions

### E*TRADE
- Standard login credentials work
- Check for security alerts in E*TRADE account

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Many brokerages use 2FA that can complicate connections:

### During Initial Connection
1. Enter your brokerage credentials in Rallies
2. Check your phone/email for a 2FA code
3. Enter the code when prompted
4. Approve any push notifications from your brokerage

### For Reconnection
- Same process as initial connection
- Some brokerages require 2FA every time

## Security Questions

If your brokerage uses security questions:
1. You may be prompted to answer during connection
2. Enter answers exactly as you set them up
3. Some connections remember answers, others ask each time

## What We Can and Can't Access

### We CAN See:
- Account holdings (stocks, ETFs, mutual funds)
- Current values
- Cost basis (if provided by brokerage)
- Recent transactions

### We CANNOT:
- Make trades on your behalf
- Transfer money
- Change your brokerage settings
- Access other financial accounts you don't connect

## Connection Security

Your brokerage credentials are:
- **Never stored** by Rallies
- **Encrypted** during transmission
- **Handled by Plaid** - Industry-standard secure aggregator
- **Read-only access** - We can only view, not trade

## If Nothing Works

If you've tried everything:

1. **Confirm your brokerage is supported** - [See list](/portfolio/supported-brokerages)
2. **Try connecting from desktop** - Mobile connections can be problematic
3. **Clear cache and try again** - Fresh session may help
4. **Contact support** with:
   - Your brokerage name
   - Error message (screenshot if possible)
   - Steps you've tried
