# Editing and Removing Holdings

Keep your portfolio accurate by editing or removing holdings as your investments change.

## Editing a Holding

### Change Share Count

If you bought or sold shares:

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find the holding you want to edit
3. Click the **"..."** menu or edit icon
4. Select **"Edit"**
5. Update the number of shares
6. Save changes

### Update Cost Basis

To correct your average cost:

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find the holding
3. Click **"Edit"**
4. Update the **"Average Cost"** or **"Cost Basis"**
5. Save changes

### Add Transaction Details

For better tracking:

1. Edit the holding
2. Click **"Add Lot"** or **"Add Transaction"**
3. Enter:
   - Purchase date
   - Number of shares
   - Price per share
4. Save

## Removing a Holding

### Sold Everything

When you've sold all shares of a stock:

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find the holding
3. Click the **"..."** menu
4. Select **"Remove"** or **"Delete"**
5. Confirm removal

### Remove from View (Keep History)

To hide without deleting:

1. Go to **Portfolio → Settings**
2. Look for **"Show sold positions"** or similar
3. Toggle to hide zero-share positions

## Connected Account vs. Manual Entry

### Connected Brokerage Holdings

If your brokerage is connected:

- **Automatic updates** - Changes sync from your brokerage
- **Can't manually edit** - Data comes from the source
- **To correct:** Check if your brokerage has the right info

If sync is wrong, you may need to:
1. Wait for next sync
2. Reconnect the account
3. Contact support if data remains incorrect

### Manual Holdings

For manually entered holdings:

- **Full control** - Edit anytime
- **Your responsibility** - Keep updated after trades
- **No automatic sync** - Changes don't reflect real brokerage

## Bulk Operations

### Update Multiple Holdings

Currently, holdings must be edited one at a time. For major updates:

1. Consider disconnecting and reconnecting your brokerage
2. Or delete and re-add manual holdings
3. Contact support for assistance with large corrections

### Import/Export

To manage holdings in bulk:

1. Go to **Portfolio → Settings**
2. Look for **"Export"** to download current holdings
3. Edit in spreadsheet
4. **"Import"** to update (if available)

## After Editing

Once you edit holdings:

- **Performance recalculates** - Your gains/losses update
- **AI insights refresh** - Analysis reflects changes
- **History preserved** - We track changes over time

## Undo Changes

Made a mistake?

- **Recent changes** - Use browser back button immediately
- **Older changes** - Re-edit with correct information
- **Connected accounts** - Will resync to correct data

## Common Scenarios

### Stock Split
If a stock split:
- Connected accounts: Auto-updates
- Manual: Edit share count (e.g., double for 2:1 split)

### Merger/Acquisition
When companies merge:
- Connected accounts: Usually updates automatically
- Manual: Remove old ticker, add new one

### Dividend Reinvestment
For DRIP shares:
- Connected accounts: New shares appear on sync
- Manual: Edit share count and cost basis

### Partial Sale
Sold some but not all shares:
- Connected accounts: Updates automatically
- Manual: Reduce share count, optionally adjust cost basis
