# Portfolio Data Security

Your financial data security is our top priority. Here's how we protect your portfolio information.

## How We Handle Your Data

### Brokerage Connections

When you connect a brokerage:

- **Credentials are never stored** - We don't save your brokerage password
- **Plaid handles authentication** - Industry-leading secure aggregator
- **Read-only access** - We can only view holdings, never make trades
- **Encrypted connections** - All data transmitted securely

### What Plaid Does

Plaid is the secure service that connects your brokerage to Rallies:

- Used by thousands of financial apps
- Bank-level security
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- Never shares your credentials with us

## Data Encryption

All portfolio data is encrypted:

| Layer | Encryption |
|-------|------------|
| In transit | TLS 1.3 |
| At rest | AES-256 |
| Backups | AES-256 |

This means your data is protected both when it's moving between your device and our servers, and when it's stored.

## What We Can See

After you connect your brokerage, we can see:

- ✓ Stock/ETF/fund holdings
- ✓ Number of shares
- ✓ Current market value
- ✓ Cost basis (if your brokerage provides it)
- ✓ Recent transactions

## What We Cannot Do

Rallies **cannot**:

- ✗ Make trades in your account
- ✗ Transfer money
- ✗ See accounts you haven't connected
- ✗ Access your brokerage password
- ✗ Share your data with third parties (without consent)

## Manual vs. Connected Portfolios

| | Manual Entry | Brokerage Connection |
|---|--------------|---------------------|
| **Data** | You enter holdings | Synced automatically |
| **Security** | No credentials needed | Secure via Plaid |
| **Updates** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Risk** | None | Minimal (read-only) |

If you're concerned about connecting your brokerage, manual entry is always available.
