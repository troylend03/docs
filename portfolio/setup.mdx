# Setting Up Your Portfolio

Track your investments in Rallies to see performance at a glance, get AI-powered insights, and understand your allocation. You can connect your brokerage for automatic syncing or add holdings manually.

## Two Ways to Set Up

| Method | Best For | Effort |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Connect Brokerage** | Automatic sync, always up-to-date | 2 minutes setup, then automatic |
| **Manual Entry** | Privacy preference, simple portfolios | 5-10 minutes, requires updates |

Most users prefer connecting their brokerage—it's faster and stays current automatically.

## Option 1: Connect Your Brokerage (Recommended)

### How It Works

We use Plaid, the same secure service used by Venmo, Robinhood, and thousands of banking apps. When you connect:

1. You log into your brokerage through Plaid's secure window
2. Plaid verifies your identity with your broker
3. Rallies receives read-only access to see your positions
4. Your holdings sync automatically

**We can see:** Your holdings, quantities, and cost basis
**We cannot see:** Your login credentials, account numbers, or make any trades

### Connect on Web

1. Click **"Portfolio"** in the left sidebar

2. Click **"Connect Brokerage"** (or **"+ Add Account"** if you've used Portfolio before)

3. Search for your brokerage
   - Type the name (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, etc.)
   - Select from the list

4. **Log in through Plaid**
   - A secure window opens
   - Enter your brokerage credentials
   - Complete any two-factor authentication your broker requires

5. **Select accounts to link**
   - Choose which accounts to sync (brokerage, IRA, etc.)
   - You can select all or just specific ones

6. Click **"Connect"**

Your holdings should appear within a few seconds. If you have many positions, it may take a minute.

### Connect on Mobile

1. Tap **"Portfolio"** in the navigation

2. Tap **"Connect Account"**

3. Search for and select your brokerage

4. Log in through the Plaid screen
   - Use Face ID/Touch ID if your broker supports it

5. Select accounts and confirm

### Supported Brokerages

**Don't see yours?** You can still use manual entry, or [let us know](/support/feedback) which brokerage you'd like us to add.

## Option 2: Add Holdings Manually

If you prefer not to connect your brokerage, you can enter holdings yourself.

### Add Holdings on Web

1. Click **"Portfolio"** in the left sidebar

2. Click **"Add Manually"** or **"+ Add Holding"**

3. For each position, enter:
   - **Ticker symbol** (e.g., AAPL)
   - **Number of shares** (e.g., 50)
   - **Cost basis per share** (optional, for gain/loss tracking)
   - **Purchase date** (optional)

4. Click **"Add"**

5. Repeat for each holding

### Add Holdings on Mobile

1. Tap **"Portfolio"**

2. Tap **"+"** or **"Add Holding"**

3. Search for the stock by ticker or name

4. Enter shares and cost basis

5. Tap **"Save"**

### Tips for Manual Entry

- **Start with your largest positions** - You don't have to enter everything at once
- **Round numbers are fine** - Exact share counts aren't critical for analysis
- **Cost basis is optional** - Without it, you won't see gain/loss, but other features still work
- **Update periodically** - Remember to add new purchases and remove sales

## What You'll See After Setup

Once your portfolio is set up, you'll have access to:

### Portfolio Overview
- **Total value** - Sum of all holdings
- **Today's change** - How much you're up or down today
- **Total gain/loss** - Overall performance (if cost basis is entered)

### Holdings List
- Each position with current value
- Individual gain/loss per holding
- Percentage of portfolio

### Allocation Breakdown
- **By sector** - Tech, Healthcare, Finance, etc.
- **By position** - Concentration in individual stocks
- Visual charts showing diversification

### AI-Powered Insights (Pro)
- Risk analysis
- Concentration warnings
- Earnings exposure
- Natural language portfolio queries

## Ask the AI About Your Portfolio

Once set up, try asking:

- "How is my portfolio doing?"
- "What's my biggest risk right now?"
- "Am I too concentrated in any sector?"
- "Which of my stocks report earnings soon?"
- "How would rising interest rates affect my portfolio?"

The AI has context about your actual holdings and can give personalized analysis.

## Portfolio Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Secure

- **Encryption:** All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Plaid security:** Bank-level security protocols
- **Read-only access:** We can never make trades or withdrawals
- **No credential storage:** We never see or store your brokerage password

### Your Data is Private

- We don't share your holdings with third parties
- You can disconnect anytime and we'll delete your synced data

## Troubleshooting Setup Issues

### "My brokerage isn't listed"

Try searching by different names (e.g., "Schwab" vs "Charles Schwab"). If it's truly not supported, use manual entry or [request we add it](/support/feedback).

### "Connection failed"

- Verify your brokerage login works directly on their site
- Check if your broker is experiencing an outage
- Try again in a few minutes
- Make sure you complete any 2FA prompts

### "Not all accounts showing"

- Go back to Plaid and make sure you selected all desired accounts
- Some account types (certain IRAs, 529s) may not sync
- Check if the account has holdings (empty accounts may not appear)

### "Holdings are wrong or missing"

- Sync can take up to 24 hours for full accuracy
- Some complex securities (options, certain ETFs) may not sync correctly
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Use manual entry to add any missing positions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to connect my brokerage?

Yes. We use Plaid, which is trusted by thousands of financial apps and banks. We receive read-only access—we can see your holdings but can never make trades, transfer money, or access your credentials.

### Can Rallies trade stocks for me?

No. Rallies is a research and tracking platform only. We have no ability to execute trades, even with a connected brokerage.

### What if I have multiple brokerage accounts?

You can connect multiple brokerages. All holdings will appear in your portfolio view, giving you a consolidated picture of your investments.

### How often does my portfolio sync?

Connected brokerages typically sync multiple times per day. For real-time positions, we recommend checking your actual brokerage app.

### Can I use both connection and manual entry?

Yes! You might connect your main brokerage and manually add holdings from elsewhere (like company stock or a spouse's account you want to track together).
