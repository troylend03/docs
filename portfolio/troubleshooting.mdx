# Portfolio Troubleshooting

Having issues with your portfolio? Find solutions to common problems here.

## Common Issues

### Holdings Not Showing

**If you just connected:**
- Wait a few minutes for initial sync
- Refresh the page
- Check if connection shows as "Connected" in settings

**If it was working before:**
1. Check if your brokerage connection is still active
2. Try reconnecting the account
3. Verify the holdings exist in your actual brokerage account

### Wrong Share Count

**For connected accounts:**
- Data comes from your brokerage—check if it's correct there
- Wait for next sync (or force sync if available)
- Reconnect if sync isn't picking up changes

**For manual entries:**
- Edit the holding and update the share count
- Make sure you're accounting for any splits

### Incorrect Prices

**Price showing wrong:**
- Real-time prices require Pro subscription
- Free tier has 15-minute delayed prices
- After-hours prices may differ from your brokerage's display

**Price not updating:**
- Check if it's outside market hours
- Refresh the page
- Some securities (OTC, foreign) update less frequently

### Missing Cost Basis

**Why it might be missing:**
- Not all brokerages provide cost basis
- Positions transferred from another broker may lack cost data
- Some security types don't have cost basis

**To fix:**
- Add cost basis manually (if option available)
- Check if your brokerage has this data
- Enter it as a manual holding with cost info

### Performance Looks Wrong

**Check these factors:**
1. **Time period** - Are you looking at the right date range?
2. **Cost basis** - Is it accurate?
3. **Dividends** - Are they included in your calculation?
4. **Deposits/Withdrawals** - These affect total return calculations

### Account Shows "Disconnected"

1. Your brokerage password may have changed
2. Session may have expired
3. Brokerage may have security updates

**To fix:**
- Click "Reconnect" and re-enter credentials
- Complete any 2FA prompts
- Check for brokerage notifications about third-party access

## Sync Issues

### Force a Sync

1. Go to **Portfolio → Connected Accounts**
2. Find the account
3. Click **"Sync Now"** or refresh icon
4. Wait for sync to complete

### Sync Takes Too Long

- Initial syncs can take several minutes
- Large accounts with many holdings take longer
- If stuck for over 10 minutes, try disconnecting and reconnecting

### Sync Frequency

| What | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Holdings | Every few hours |
| Prices | Continuous (market hours) |
| Transactions | Daily |

## Data Discrepancies

### Portfolio Value Different from Brokerage

Common reasons:
- **Timing** - Rallies may have slightly delayed data
- **Cash** - Cash balances may not be included
- **Margin** - Margin positions displayed differently
- **Options** - Options may not be fully supported

### Performance Different from Brokerage

Different platforms calculate performance differently:
- **Time-weighted vs. money-weighted returns**
- **Dividend treatment**
- **Fee inclusion**
- **Date range differences**

## Manual Portfolio Issues

### Can't Add a Stock

- Make sure you're entering a valid ticker symbol
- Try searching by company name
- Some OTC or international stocks may not be available

### Duplicate Holdings

If the same stock appears twice:
1. Check if one is manual and one is from connected account
2. Delete the duplicate
3. Consider using either connection OR manual, not both for same security
