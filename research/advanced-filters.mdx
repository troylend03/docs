# Advanced Screener Filters

The Vibe Screener lets you describe what you want in plain English, but sometimes you need more precision. Advanced filters give you granular control over exactly which stocks appear in your results.

## When to Use Advanced Filters

Basic natural language searches work great for general ideas:
> "Undervalued tech stocks"

Advanced filters are better when you need:
- Specific numerical thresholds (P/E under 15, not just "cheap")
- Multiple precise criteria combined
- Reproducible, consistent screens
- Exclusion of specific categories

## Accessing Advanced Filters

### On Web

1. Go to **Screener** in the left sidebar
2. Run any initial search or start fresh
3. Click **"Advanced Filters"** or the filter icon
4. A filter panel opens with all available options

### On Mobile

1. Navigate to **Screener**
2. Tap the **filter icon** at the top
3. Browse available filter categories
4. Apply your selections

## Filter Categories

Advanced filters are organized into logical categories. Here's what's available:

## Combining Multiple Filters

The real power comes from combining filters. All active filters work together—results must pass ALL filters to appear.

### Example: Quality Value Screen

Find high-quality companies at reasonable prices:

1. **P/E Ratio:** 10 - 20
2. **ROE:** Greater than 15%
3. **Debt/Equity:** Less than 0.5
4. **Revenue Growth YoY:** Greater than 5%
5. **Market Cap:** Greater than $10B

This screens for profitable, growing, financially healthy large caps that aren't overpriced.

### Example: Dividend Growth Screen

Find reliable dividend growers:

1. **Dividend Yield:** 2% - 5%
2. **Payout Ratio:** Less than 60%
3. **Years of Increases:** Greater than 10
4. **Debt/Equity:** Less than 1
5. **EPS Growth 5Y:** Greater than 3%

This finds sustainable dividend payers with room to keep growing payouts.

### Example: Small Cap Growth Screen

Find fast-growing smaller companies:

1. **Market Cap:** $500M - $5B
2. **Revenue Growth YoY:** Greater than 25%
3. **Gross Margin:** Greater than 40%
4. **Average Volume:** Greater than 200,000

This screens for liquid small caps with strong growth and healthy margins.

## Mixing Natural Language with Filters

You don't have to choose one or the other. Use both together:

1. **Start with natural language:** "Tech stocks with strong competitive moats"
2. **Then apply filters:** P/E under 30, Market Cap over $5B
3. **Result:** AI-interpreted quality + your specific parameters

This combines the AI's understanding of qualitative factors with your precise quantitative requirements.

## Managing Your Filters

### Clearing Filters

To start fresh:
- Click **"Clear All"** to remove all active filters
- Or click the **X** next to individual filters to remove them one by one

### Viewing Active Filters

Active filters appear as tags/chips above your results. You can see at a glance what criteria are being applied.

### Filter Presets

Some common filter combinations are available as presets:

- **Value Stocks:** Low P/E, low P/B, reasonable debt
- **Growth Stocks:** High revenue growth, expanding margins
- **Dividend Aristocrats:** Long dividend increase streaks
- **Quality Companies:** High ROE, strong margins, low debt
- **Momentum:** Near 52-week highs, strong volume

Click a preset to instantly apply those filters, then customize as needed.

## Tips for Effective Filtering

### 1. Don't Over-Filter

Adding too many strict filters can leave you with zero results. Start with a few key criteria and add more gradually.

**Too strict:**
- P/E under 10
- AND Revenue Growth over 30%
- AND Dividend Yield over 4%
- AND Debt/Equity under 0.2
- AND ROE over 25%

Very few stocks meet all these criteria simultaneously.

### 2. Understand Filter Trade-offs

Some filters naturally conflict:
- **High growth** stocks often have **high valuations**
- **High dividend yields** often mean **lower growth**
- **Low debt** companies may have **lower ROE** (less leverage)

Be realistic about what combinations are achievable.

### 3. Use Ranges, Not Just Minimums

Instead of just "P/E under 20," consider "P/E between 10 and 20."

This avoids:
- Extremely low P/E stocks that might be in trouble
- Negative P/E (unprofitable companies)

### 4. Consider What You're Excluding

Every filter excludes something. A "profitable companies only" filter excludes:
- Early-stage growth companies
- Turnaround situations
- Companies with temporary earnings hits

Make sure you're OK missing those opportunities.

### 5. Validate Results

After running a filtered screen, spot-check a few results:
- Do they actually meet your criteria?
- Are there any surprises?
- Does the AI interpretation match your intent?

## Troubleshooting

### No Results

If your screen returns nothing:
1. You likely have too many strict filters
2. Remove filters one at a time until results appear
3. Consider which filter is most restrictive
4. Try widening your ranges

### Too Many Results

If you get overwhelming results:
1. Add more filters to narrow down
2. Make existing filters stricter
3. Add a market cap minimum for more established companies
4. Add profitability requirements

### Unexpected Results

If stocks appear that shouldn't match:
- Check if you're using the right filter direction (greater than vs. less than)
- Verify your numerical inputs are correct
- Remember that financial data has a lag—recent changes may not be reflected
- Some edge cases may have unusual data

### Filter Not Available

If you can't find a specific filter:
- Try the search within the filter panel
- Some advanced filters are Pro-only features
- Some metrics aren't available for all stocks (especially international)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are advanced filters available on the free plan?

Basic filters are available to everyone. Some advanced filters and the ability to save filtered screens require Pro.

### How current is the financial data used for filters?

Financial data updates quarterly when companies report earnings. Price-based filters use current market data. There may be a few days lag after earnings reports.

### Can I filter for negative values?

Yes. For example, you can filter for negative earnings growth (shrinking earnings) or negative P/E (losses). This is useful for finding turnaround candidates or avoiding troubled companies.

### Do filters work on ETFs?

Most filters work on individual stocks. ETFs have limited filter support since they don't have individual company financials.

### Can I share my filter settings with someone?

If you save a screen with your filters, you can share the saved screen link with other Rallies users. They'll see the same filter configuration.
