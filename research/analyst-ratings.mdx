# What Analyst Ratings Mean

Wall Street analysts publish ratings and price targets on stocks. Rallies displays this data on stock pages to help inform your research. But what do these ratings actually mean, and how should you use them?

> Analyst ratings are one input for your research, not recommendations from Rallies. Rallies does not provide investment advice. Always do your own due diligence before making investment decisions.

## How Analyst Ratings Work

### Who Are Analysts?

Analysts are professionals at investment banks, brokerages, and research firms who:
- Study specific companies and industries in depth
- Build financial models to estimate future performance
- Publish research reports with their conclusions
- Issue ratings and price targets

Major firms include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, UBS, and many others.

### What They Publish

Analysts typically publish:
- **Ratings:** Their recommendation (buy, hold, sell, or variations)
- **Price Targets:** Where they expect the stock to trade
- **Research Reports:** Detailed analysis supporting their view
- **Earnings Estimates:** Projections for future quarters and years

## Understanding Ratings

### Common Rating Categories

Different firms use different terminology, but ratings generally fall into these categories:

| Category | Common Terms | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Strong Buy** | Strong Buy, Conviction Buy | Highest conviction positive rating |
| **Buy** | Buy, Outperform, Overweight | Analyst expects stock to beat the market |
| **Hold** | Hold, Neutral, Market Perform, Equal Weight | Analyst expects stock to perform in line with market |
| **Sell** | Sell, Underperform, Underweight | Analyst expects stock to lag the market |
| **Strong Sell** | Strong Sell | Highest conviction negative rating (rare) |

### Why Terminology Varies

Each firm has its own rating system. "Outperform" at one firm is equivalent to "Buy" at another. Rallies normalizes these into standard categories for easier comparison.

### Consensus Rating

The consensus rating combines all analyst ratings into a single summary:

**How it works:**
1. Each rating is assigned a numerical value (e.g., Strong Buy = 5, Buy = 4, Hold = 3, Sell = 2, Strong Sell = 1)
2. The average is calculated
3. The result is displayed as a consensus (e.g., "Buy" or "Hold")

**Example:**
- 10 analysts rate a stock
- 5 say Buy (4), 4 say Hold (3), 1 says Sell (2)
- Average: (5x4 + 4x3 + 1x2) / 10 = 3.4
- Consensus: Moderate Buy

### Rating Distribution

Beyond the consensus, look at the distribution:
- **10 Buys, 0 Holds, 0 Sells:** Strong consensus
- **5 Buys, 3 Holds, 2 Sells:** Divided opinions

A split opinion might warrant investigating why analysts disagree.

## Price Targets

### What Is a Price Target?

A price target is an analyst's estimate of where the stock price should trade, typically over the next 12 months.

### Price Target Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Average Target** | Mean of all analyst targets |
| **Median Target** | Middle target (less affected by outliers) |
| **High Target** | Most optimistic analyst view |
| **Low Target** | Most pessimistic analyst view |
| **Upside/Downside** | Percentage from current price to average target |

### How to Interpret Targets

**Example:**
- Current Price: $100
- Average Target: $120
- High Target: $150
- Low Target: $90
- Upside: +20%

This suggests analysts, on average, expect 20% upside. But the range from $90 to $150 shows significant disagreement.

### Target Accuracy

Research shows analyst price targets are directionally useful but often inaccurate in magnitude:
- Analysts tend to be optimistic
- Targets are frequently revised
- Actual outcomes often fall outside the projected range

Use targets as one data point, not as precise predictions.

## Rating Changes

When analysts change their ratings, it can move stock prices. Rallies shows recent rating changes.

### Types of Changes

| Change Type | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Upgrade** | Rating improved (e.g., Hold to Buy) |
| **Downgrade** | Rating lowered (e.g., Buy to Hold) |
| **Initiated** | Analyst starts coverage with initial rating |
| **Reiterated** | Analyst maintains current rating (often with new target) |

### Why Ratings Change

- **Earnings results:** Beat or miss expectations
- **Guidance changes:** Company raises or lowers outlook
- **Industry developments:** Sector-wide factors
- **Valuation:** Stock moved significantly
- **New information:** Product launches, competitive changes, management shifts

### Impact of Rating Changes

Upgrades and downgrades can cause short-term price movements:
- Upgrades often push prices higher
- Downgrades often push prices lower
- Impact is largest when unexpected or from influential analysts

---

## Earnings Estimates

Analysts also publish earnings estimates for upcoming quarters and years.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **EPS Estimate** | Expected earnings per share |
| **Revenue Estimate** | Expected total sales |
| **Consensus Estimate** | Average of all analyst estimates |
| **Estimate Range** | High and low estimates |
| **Revisions** | How estimates have changed over time |

### Earnings Surprises

When companies report actual results:
- **Beat:** Actual exceeds estimate (usually positive for stock)
- **Miss:** Actual falls short of estimate (usually negative for stock)
- **In-line:** Actual matches estimate (muted reaction)

### Forward Guidance Matters

The stock's reaction to earnings often depends more on forward guidance than the actual results. A company can beat estimates but drop if guidance disappoints.

## How to Use Analyst Data

### As One Input, Not the Answer

Analyst ratings should inform, not dictate, your decisions:
- Consider why they have their view
- Understand their assumptions
- Weigh against your own research
- Remember analysts can be wrong

### Look for Consensus Shifts

A single rating change may not matter. But if multiple analysts are moving in the same direction, pay attention—it might reflect genuinely changing fundamentals.

### Consider the Source

Some analysts have better track records than others. Consider:
- How accurate has this analyst been on this stock?
- Is this analyst an expert in this industry?
- Does the firm have potential conflicts of interest?

### Use Disagreement as Research Fuel

When analysts disagree:
- Read the bull and bear cases
- Understand what would need to happen for each view to be right
- Form your own informed opinion

### Track Changes Over Time

Estimate revisions over time can be more informative than a single snapshot:
- Consistently rising estimates: Positive trend
- Consistently falling estimates: Negative trend
- Stable estimates: Expectations are set

## Limitations of Analyst Ratings

### Optimism Bias

Studies show analysts are more likely to issue Buy ratings than Sell ratings. Reasons include:
- Relationships with company management
- Investment banking business considerations
- Career risk (being wrong on the downside is punished more)

**Result:** Take "Hold" ratings as potentially more negative than they appear.

### Lagging Indicators

Analysts often upgrade after stocks have already risen and downgrade after they've fallen. By the time there's consensus, the move may be largely complete.

### Herding Behavior

Analysts tend to cluster around similar targets. An analyst who is too far from consensus takes career risk. This can reduce the information value of consensus estimates.

### Conflicts of Interest

Analysts at investment banks may have conflicts:
- Their firm may do business with the company
- Their firm may own the stock
- Internal pressure to support banking relationships

Independent research firms may have fewer conflicts but less access to management.

### Not a Substitute for Research

Even correct ratings don't tell you:
- At what price to buy
- How long to hold
- How the stock fits your portfolio
- Your personal risk tolerance

## Analyst Data in Rallies

### Where to Find It

On any stock page, look for the **Analysts** section:
- Consensus rating
- Rating distribution
- Price targets
- Recent rating changes
- Earnings estimates

### Using the AI

Ask the AI to help interpret analyst data:

> "What do analysts think about this stock?"

> "How have estimates changed recently?"

> "What's the bull case analysts are making?"

> "Why might analysts be wrong about this company?"

The AI can summarize analyst sentiment and provide context.

## Tips for Working with Analyst Ratings

### 1. Focus on Changes, Not Levels

A stock with a consensus "Buy" rating has probably had that rating for a while. More informative: Are ratings and estimates improving or deteriorating?

### 2. Understand the Why

The rating itself matters less than the reasoning. Read research summaries or ask the AI to explain the bull and bear cases.

### 3. Consider Coverage

More analyst coverage generally means:
- More reliable consensus
- Greater institutional interest
- More efficient pricing

Stocks with few analysts may be mispriced but have less reliable data.

### 4. Check the Track Record

When possible, consider how accurate analysts have been on this specific stock historically.

### 5. Be Contrarian Carefully

Sometimes the consensus is wrong, and going against it can be profitable. But being contrarian for its own sake is dangerous. Have a well-reasoned thesis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I buy a stock because analysts rate it a "Buy"?

No. Analyst ratings are one input for research, not a recommendation to buy. Consider your own research, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

### Why are there so few "Sell" ratings?

Analysts have structural incentives to be positive. "Hold" ratings often function as soft sells. A true "Sell" rating is relatively rare and may signal significant concerns.

### How often do analysts update ratings?

It varies. Major updates typically follow earnings reports, significant news, or meaningful stock price changes. Some analysts update more frequently than others.

### Can I see the full research report?

Rallies displays summary data. Full research reports are typically available only to institutional clients or through paid subscriptions to research services.

### How much do ratings affect stock prices?

Rating changes can cause short-term price movements, especially for smaller stocks or changes from influential analysts. For large, heavily followed stocks, the impact is often smaller.

### What does it mean when all analysts have the same rating?

Strong consensus can mean the view is well-established (and possibly priced in). It can also mean herding. Investigate whether the consensus reflects genuine fundamentals.

### Are independent analysts more reliable?

Independent analysts may have fewer conflicts of interest but potentially less access to management. Neither is universally more reliable. Consider the source and their track record.
