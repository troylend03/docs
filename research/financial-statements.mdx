# Understanding Financial Statements

Financial statements tell the story of a company's financial health. Every public company reports them quarterly and annually, and Rallies displays them on every stock page. This guide helps you understand what you're looking at.

> Rallies provides financial data for educational and research purposes. This information does not constitute investment advice. Always do your own due diligence before making investment decisions.

## The Three Financial Statements

Public companies report three core financial statements:

1. **Income Statement** — Shows profitability over a period (like a video)
2. **Balance Sheet** — Shows financial position at a point in time (like a snapshot)
3. **Cash Flow Statement** — Shows actual cash moving in and out (follows the money)

Each tells a different part of the story. Together, they give you a complete picture.

## Accessing Financial Statements in Rallies

### On a Stock Page

1. Search for any stock
2. Open the stock page
3. Scroll to **Financials** section, or click the **Financials** tab
4. Toggle between Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow
5. Switch between **Annual** and **Quarterly** views

### Timeframes

- **Annual:** Full fiscal year results (most complete picture)
- **Quarterly:** Three-month periods (more current, less smooth)

Most analysis focuses on annual data for trends, with quarterly data for recent developments.

## The Income Statement

The income statement shows whether a company made or lost money over a period. It starts with revenue and works down to net income (the "bottom line").

### Key Line Items

#### Revenue (Sales)

**What it is:** Total money received from selling products or services.

**Why it matters:** Revenue is the top line—everything else flows from here. Growing revenue usually means growing demand for what the company sells.

**What to look for:**
- Is revenue growing year over year?
- How fast compared to competitors?
- Is growth accelerating or slowing?

#### Cost of Revenue (COGS)

**What it is:** Direct costs to produce what was sold (materials, manufacturing, etc.).

**Why it matters:** This determines gross profit. Lower costs relative to revenue means better margins.

#### Gross Profit

**What it is:** Revenue minus cost of revenue.

**Formula:** Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit

**Why it matters:** Shows how much the company makes before overhead. Higher gross profit means more money available to cover expenses and generate profits.

**Gross Margin:** Gross Profit / Revenue (expressed as percentage)

| Industry | Typical Gross Margin |
|----------|---------------------|
| Software | 70-90% |
| Retail | 25-40% |
| Manufacturing | 20-35% |
| Restaurants | 60-70% |

#### Operating Expenses

**What they include:**
- **R&D (Research & Development):** Spending on innovation
- **SG&A (Selling, General & Administrative):** Sales, marketing, management, offices
- **Depreciation & Amortization:** Spreading costs of assets over time

**Why it matters:** These are the costs of running the business day-to-day. Efficient companies keep operating expenses in check relative to revenue.

#### Operating Income (EBIT)

**What it is:** Gross profit minus operating expenses.

**Formula:** Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Operating Income

**Why it matters:** This shows profit from core business operations, before interest and taxes. It's a key measure of operational efficiency.

**Operating Margin:** Operating Income / Revenue

#### Interest Expense

**What it is:** Cost of borrowing money (debt payments).

**Why it matters:** High interest expense can eat into profits and signal heavy debt loads.

#### Net Income

**What it is:** The "bottom line"—profit after all expenses, interest, and taxes.

**Formula:** Operating Income - Interest - Taxes = Net Income

**Why it matters:** This is what's left for shareholders. It can be reinvested, paid as dividends, or used to buy back stock.

**Net Margin:** Net Income / Revenue

#### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

**What it is:** Net income divided by shares outstanding.

**Formula:** Net Income / Shares Outstanding = EPS

**Why it matters:** EPS is the most-watched metric. It shows profit on a per-share basis, making it easy to compare companies of different sizes and track growth over time.

### Reading the Income Statement

**Positive signs:**
- Revenue growing consistently
- Margins stable or expanding
- EPS growing faster than revenue (operating leverage)

**Warning signs:**
- Revenue declining
- Margins shrinking
- EPS growing only through cost cuts (not sustainable)

## The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet shows what a company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) at a specific point in time, plus shareholders' equity (the difference).

**The fundamental equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

### Key Line Items

#### Assets

**Current Assets** (convertible to cash within one year):

| Item | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| **Cash & Equivalents** | Money in the bank, short-term investments |
| **Accounts Receivable** | Money owed by customers |
| **Inventory** | Products waiting to be sold |
| **Prepaid Expenses** | Payments made in advance |

**Non-Current Assets** (long-term):

| Item | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| **Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)** | Buildings, machinery, land |
| **Intangible Assets** | Patents, trademarks, brand value |
| **Goodwill** | Premium paid for acquisitions |
| **Long-term Investments** | Stakes in other companies |

#### Liabilities

**Current Liabilities** (due within one year):

| Item | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| **Accounts Payable** | Money owed to suppliers |
| **Short-term Debt** | Loans due within a year |
| **Accrued Expenses** | Obligations incurred but not yet paid |
| **Deferred Revenue** | Payments received for future delivery |

**Non-Current Liabilities** (long-term):

| Item | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| **Long-term Debt** | Bonds, loans due after one year |
| **Lease Obligations** | Long-term lease commitments |
| **Pension Liabilities** | Future pension obligations |
| **Deferred Taxes** | Taxes owed in the future |

#### Shareholders' Equity

**What it is:** The owners' stake in the company after all liabilities are paid.

**Key components:**
- **Common Stock:** Par value of shares issued
- **Additional Paid-in Capital:** Money received above par value
- **Retained Earnings:** Accumulated profits not paid as dividends
- **Treasury Stock:** Shares bought back (reduces equity)

### Key Balance Sheet Metrics

#### Current Ratio

**Formula:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities

**What it measures:** Ability to pay short-term obligations.

**Interpretation:**
- Above 1.5: Comfortable liquidity
- 1.0 - 1.5: Adequate
- Below 1.0: Potential liquidity concerns

#### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

**Formula:** Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity

**What it measures:** Financial leverage—how much the company relies on debt.

**Interpretation:**
- Below 0.5: Conservative
- 0.5 - 1.0: Moderate
- Above 1.0: Higher leverage (not necessarily bad, but worth understanding)

#### Book Value Per Share

**Formula:** Shareholders' Equity / Shares Outstanding

**What it measures:** Net asset value per share.

**Use:** Basis for P/B (price-to-book) ratio.

### Reading the Balance Sheet

**Positive signs:**
- Growing cash and equity
- Manageable debt levels
- Strong current ratio

**Warning signs:**
- Declining cash
- Rapidly increasing debt
- Goodwill larger than tangible assets
- Current ratio below 1

## The Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement shows actual cash coming in and going out. Unlike the income statement (which uses accrual accounting), this tracks real money movement.

**Why it matters:** A company can show profits on the income statement but still run out of cash. Cash flow reveals the truth.

### Three Sections

#### Operating Cash Flow (CFO)

**What it is:** Cash generated from core business operations.

**Starts with:** Net income

**Adjusted for:**
- Depreciation (add back—non-cash expense)
- Changes in working capital (receivables, inventory, payables)
- Other non-cash items

**Why it matters:** This is the cash engine of the business. Healthy companies generate positive operating cash flow consistently.

**Key insight:** Operating cash flow should exceed net income over time. If net income consistently exceeds operating cash flow, the company may be recognizing revenue it hasn't collected.

#### Investing Cash Flow (CFI)

**What it is:** Cash spent on (or received from) long-term investments.

**Includes:**
- Capital expenditures (CapEx)—buying property, equipment
- Acquisitions
- Sales of assets
- Investment purchases/sales

**Why it matters:** Shows how the company is investing for the future.

**Typical pattern:** Usually negative (companies spend on growth). Positive could mean selling assets.

**Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** The key line item. This is spending to maintain and grow the business. Subtract from operating cash flow to get free cash flow.

#### Financing Cash Flow (CFF)

**What it is:** Cash from financial activities.

**Includes:**
- Issuing stock (positive)
- Buying back stock (negative)
- Taking on debt (positive)
- Paying off debt (negative)
- Paying dividends (negative)

**Why it matters:** Shows how the company finances itself and returns capital to shareholders.

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

**Formula:** Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures = Free Cash Flow

**What it is:** Cash available after maintaining and investing in the business.

**Why it matters:** This is the cash truly available for:
- Paying dividends
- Buying back shares
- Reducing debt
- Making acquisitions
- Building cash reserves

Many investors consider free cash flow the most important metric. A company can manipulate earnings more easily than cash flow.

### Reading the Cash Flow Statement

**Positive signs:**
- Strong, growing operating cash flow
- Operating cash flow exceeds net income
- Consistent free cash flow generation
- Returns to shareholders (buybacks, dividends)

**Warning signs:**
- Negative operating cash flow (sustained)
- Operating cash flow below net income
- Heavy reliance on debt/stock issuance
- CapEx cuts to preserve cash (underinvestment)

## Putting It All Together

### How the Statements Connect

1. **Net income** from the income statement flows into **retained earnings** on the balance sheet
2. **Net income** is the starting point for the **cash flow statement**
3. **Cash** on the balance sheet equals ending cash on the cash flow statement
4. **Debt** on the balance sheet connects to interest expense (income statement) and financing activities (cash flow)

### Common Analysis Patterns

**Growth company:**
- Rising revenue and gross profit
- May have negative net income (investing in growth)
- Strong operating cash flow
- High CapEx (investing heavily)
- May issue stock to fund growth

**Value company:**
- Stable or slow-growing revenue
- Consistent profits and margins
- Strong free cash flow
- Returns cash via dividends and buybacks
- May have higher debt levels (using leverage)

**Turnaround situation:**
- Revenue may be flat or declining
- Margins improving (cost cuts)
- Cash flow improving
- Debt being paid down
- Focus on core business

### Using the AI for Analysis

Ask the AI to help interpret financial statements:

> "What does the trend in operating margins tell me about this company?"

> "Is this company's debt level concerning?"

> "How does free cash flow compare to net income?"

> "Explain the balance sheet for someone new to investing"

The AI can provide context, comparisons, and explanations that bring the numbers to life.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is net income different from free cash flow?

Net income uses accrual accounting—it recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, not when cash changes hands. Free cash flow tracks actual cash. They can differ significantly due to timing, non-cash expenses (depreciation), and working capital changes.

### What's a good debt-to-equity ratio?

It depends on the industry. Utilities often have high leverage (1.0+) because they have stable cash flows. Tech companies often have low leverage (under 0.5). Compare to industry peers rather than using absolute rules.

### How often do financial statements update?

Quarterly (about 45 days after quarter end) and annually. The annual 10-K filing has the most detail; quarterly 10-Q filings are more abbreviated.

### What if some line items are missing?

Data availability varies. Smaller companies may have less detailed breakdowns. International companies may report differently. Rallies shows what's available from public filings.

### Should I look at GAAP or non-GAAP numbers?

Rallies primarily shows GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) numbers, which are standardized. Companies sometimes report "adjusted" or non-GAAP figures that exclude certain items. GAAP provides comparability; adjusted figures can provide insight but should be viewed skeptically.
