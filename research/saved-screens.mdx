# Saving and Managing Screens

Once you've built a great stock screen, save it so you can run it again anytime. Saved screens let you track your favorite strategies, monitor when new stocks match your criteria, and stay organized.

> This is a Pro feature. [Upgrade to Pro](/billing/upgrade) for saved screens, alerts, and more.

## Why Save Screens

### Quick Access

Instead of rebuilding a screen from scratch every time, one click runs your saved screen with all your criteria intact.

### Consistency

The same filters and criteria every time means you can track results over time and see what's changed.

### Alerts

Set up notifications when new stocks match your saved screen criteria—great for finding opportunities as they emerge.

### Organization

Build a library of screens for different strategies, market conditions, or research purposes.

## Saving a Screen

### After Running a Screen

1. Run any screen using the Vibe Screener (natural language or filters)
2. Review your results
3. Click **"Save Screen"** or the **bookmark icon**
4. Give your screen a name (be descriptive!)
5. Optionally add a description or tags
6. Click **"Save"**

Your screen is now saved with:
- The search query you used
- All active filters
- Any sorting preferences

### Quick Save

If you've run a screen you like, look for the **"Save"** button in the results header. This provides a faster way to save without opening a full dialog.

### Naming Your Screens

Good names help you remember what each screen does:

**Good names:**
- "Undervalued Large Cap Tech"
- "Dividend Growth - Low Payout"
- "Small Cap Momentum Breakouts"
- "Quality Value (Buffett Style)"

**Poor names:**
- "Screen 1"
- "Test"
- "Stocks"

Be specific enough that you'll know what the screen does months from now.

## Accessing Saved Screens

### On Web

1. Click **"Screener"** in the left sidebar
2. Look for **"Saved Screens"** tab or section

4. Click any screen to open it

### On Mobile

3. Select a saved screen from your list

### From the Dashboard

If you have frequently used screens, they may appear on your dashboard for quick access.

## Running a Saved Screen

1. Open your saved screens list
2. Click the screen you want to run
3. The screen automatically runs with your saved criteria
4. View fresh results based on current market data

Results update in real-time—you'll see which stocks match your criteria right now, not when you originally saved the screen.

## Editing Saved Screens

### Modify Search Criteria

1. Open a saved screen
2. Click **"Edit"** or the pencil icon
3. Modify the search query

Your screen is updated with the new criteria.

### Rename a Screen

2. Click the **three-dot menu** (⋯) next to the screen
3. Select **"Rename"**
4. Enter a new name
5. Save

### Update Description

1. Open the screen's settings (⋯ menu or Edit)
2. Find the description field
3. Update your notes about the screen
4. Save changes

## Organizing Screens

### Using Folders

Keep screens organized with folders:

1. In Saved Screens, click **"New Folder"**
2. Name your folder (e.g., "Value Strategies," "Dividend Screens")
3. Drag screens into folders, or move them via the ⋯ menu

**Suggested folder structure:**
- **By Strategy:** Value, Growth, Income, Momentum
- **By Market Cap:** Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap
- **By Sector:** Tech, Healthcare, Financials
- **By Purpose:** Research, Watchlist Building, Learning

### Using Tags

Some users prefer tags over folders:

1. Edit a saved screen
2. Add relevant tags
3. Filter your screen list by tag

Tags let a screen belong to multiple categories.

### Favorites

Star your most-used screens:

1. Click the **star icon** next to any saved screen
2. Starred screens appear at the top of your list
3. Quick access to your go-to strategies

## Screen Alerts

Get notified when new stocks match your saved screen criteria.

### Setting Up Alerts

1. Open a saved screen
2. Click **"Set Alert"** or the bell icon
3. Choose your notification preferences:
   - Email
   - Push notification
   - In-app notification
4. Set frequency (instant, daily digest, weekly)
5. Activate the alert

### How Screen Alerts Work

1. **Rallies monitors** your saved criteria continuously
2. **New matches appear** when stocks meet your criteria that didn't before
3. **You're notified** based on your preferences
4. **Review the new matches** and decide if they warrant further research

### Alert Frequency Options

| Option | When You're Notified |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Instant** | As soon as a new match is found |
| **Daily Digest** | Once per day with all new matches |
| **Weekly Summary** | Once per week with all new matches |

**Tip:** Use daily digest to avoid notification overload from broad screens.

### Managing Alerts

**View all screen alerts:**
- Go to **Settings > Notifications > Screen Alerts**
- Or check the **Alerts** section

**Pause an alert:**
- Toggle the alert off temporarily
- Turn it back on when ready

**Delete an alert:**
- Remove the alert entirely from the screen settings

## Sharing Screens

### Share with Other Rallies Users

1. Open a saved screen
2. Click **"Share"** or the share icon
3. Copy the share link
4. Send to another Rallies user

The recipient can view and run your screen. They can also save their own copy if they want to modify it.

### What Gets Shared

When you share a screen:
- The search query is shared
- All filters and criteria are shared
- Your results are NOT shared (they run it fresh)
- Your personal data is NOT exposed

### Importing Shared Screens

When someone shares a screen with you:

1. Click the shared link
2. The screen opens in your Screener
3. Run it to see current results
4. Click **"Save to My Screens"** to keep it

## Duplicating Screens

Create a copy of a screen to make variations:

1. Open the saved screen or find it in your list
2. Click ⋯ > **"Duplicate"**
3. A copy is created with "(Copy)" appended to the name
4. Edit the copy to make your modifications
5. Rename it to reflect the changes

**Use cases:**
- Test modifications without changing the original
- Create variations (e.g., same strategy but different market caps)
- Build on shared screens without modifying the source

## Deleting Screens

### Delete a Single Screen

1. Go to Saved Screens
2. Find the screen to delete
3. Click ⋯ > **"Delete"**
4. Confirm deletion

Deleted screens cannot be recovered.

### Bulk Delete

If you need to clean up multiple screens:

1. Enter selection mode (if available)
2. Select multiple screens
3. Click **"Delete Selected"**
4. Confirm

## Screen History

### Viewing Run History

Some users want to see how their screen results have changed over time:

1. Open a saved screen
2. Look for **"History"** or **"Past Results"**
3. View previous runs and how many matches you had

This helps track whether your criteria are becoming more or less restrictive over time.

### Comparing Results Over Time

If you notice your screen returning very different results:
- Check if market conditions have changed
- Review whether your criteria still make sense
- Consider adjusting thresholds if the market has shifted

## Tips for Managing Screens

### 1. Review Screens Periodically

Markets change. A screen that made sense last year might need updating:
- Valuation thresholds may need adjustment
- Growth expectations might be different
- Economic conditions affect what's "cheap" or "expensive"

Schedule quarterly reviews of your saved screens.

### 2. Archive Instead of Delete

If you're not sure whether to delete a screen, move it to an "Archive" folder instead. You can delete later if you never use it.

### 3. Document Your Reasoning

Use the description field to note:
- Why you created the screen
- What market conditions it's designed for
- Any context that will help future-you understand it

### 4. Start with Broad Screens, Save Refined Versions

Build iteratively:
1. Create a broad screen
2. Run it and review results
3. Refine with additional filters
4. Save the refined version
5. Repeat until you have what you want

### 5. Name Screens for Easy Search

If you have many saved screens, good naming lets you search:
- Include strategy type (value, growth, dividend)
- Include key criteria (low PE, high yield)
- Include market cap if relevant

## Troubleshooting

### Screen Not Saving

If your screen won't save:
- Ensure you have a Pro subscription
- Check that you've given it a name
- Try refreshing the page and saving again
- Check your internet connection

### Saved Screen Returns Different Results

This is expected! Results update based on current market data. Stocks that matched last week may not match today (and vice versa) as prices and fundamentals change.

### Alerts Not Working

If you're not receiving screen alerts:
- Check that the alert is enabled (not paused)
- Verify notification settings in Settings > Notifications
- For email: check spam folder
- For push: ensure app notifications are enabled on your device

### Screen Limit Reached

Pro users have generous screen limits, but if you hit the limit:
- Delete screens you no longer use
- Consolidate similar screens
- Archive old screens to a folder (doesn't count against limit if archived)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many screens can I save?

Pro users can save up to 50 screens. This limit is generous for most users, but if you need more, contact support.

### Do saved screens update automatically?

The screen criteria stay the same, but results are always current when you run the screen. You see which stocks match your criteria today, not historical results.

### Can I save screens from the AI chat?

Yes! If you ask the AI to screen for stocks, you can save that query as a screen. Look for the "Save as Screen" option in the chat interface.

### What happens to my screens if I downgrade from Pro?

Your screens are preserved but become view-only. You can't edit them or run them until you upgrade again. Alerts are paused.

### Can I export my saved screens?

Currently, screens live within Rallies. You can share them with other users via links. Full export functionality may be added in the future.
