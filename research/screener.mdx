# Using the Vibe Screener

The Vibe Screener finds stocks using natural language instead of complicated filters. Just describe what you're looking for—"undervalued tech stocks with strong cash flow"—and AI finds matches for you.

## How the Vibe Screener Works

Traditional screeners require you to:
- Know which metrics to filter
- Set specific numerical ranges
- Combine multiple complex criteria

The Vibe Screener is different:
1. **You describe** what you want in plain English
2. **AI translates** your description into relevant criteria
3. **Matching stocks** are returned with explanations

It's like having a research assistant who understands what you're looking for.

## Getting Started

### On Web

1. Click **"Screener"** in the left sidebar (or navigate to the Research section)
2. You'll see the **Vibe Screener** input box
3. Type what you're looking for
4. Press **Enter** or click **"Search"**
5. Review results

### On Mobile

1. Tap **"Research"** or **"Screener"** in the navigation
2. Tap the search/input area
3. Describe what you want
4. Tap **"Search"**
5. Browse results

## Example Searches

## Understanding Results

When you run a screen, you'll see:

### Stock List
A table of matching stocks showing:
- Ticker symbol and company name
- Current price
- Key metrics relevant to your search
- Why each stock matched (match explanation)

### Match Quality
Stocks are ranked by how well they fit your criteria. Top results are the strongest matches.

### Relevant Metrics
The screener shows metrics that matter for your specific search. A dividend search shows yield and payout ratio; a growth search shows revenue growth rates.

## Saving Screens

### Save for Later (Pro)

If you want to run the same screen again:

1. Run your screen
2. Click **"Save Screen"** or the bookmark icon
3. Name your saved screen
4. Access it anytime from **Saved Screens**

### Saved Screen Alerts (Pro)

Set up alerts when new stocks match your saved criteria:

1. Open a saved screen
2. Click **"Set Alert"**
3. Choose notification preferences
4. Get notified when new matches appear

## Refining Results

### Be More Specific

If results are too broad, add more criteria:

**Too broad:** "Tech stocks"
**Better:** "Profitable tech stocks under $50 billion market cap with positive cash flow"

### Try Different Angles

The same concept can be expressed different ways:

- "Cheap stocks" vs "Undervalued stocks" vs "Stocks with low P/E"
- "Growing companies" vs "High growth stocks" vs "Revenue growth over 20%"

If one phrasing doesn't give great results, try another.

### Exclude What You Don't Want

You can specify exclusions:

> "Dividend stocks, but not REITs or utilities"

> "Tech stocks excluding mega caps"

> "Growing companies that aren't losing money"

## Tips for Better Screens

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with a general idea, see what comes back, then refine:
1. "Dividend stocks" → too many results
2. "Dividend stocks with yield over 3%" → better
3. "Dividend stocks, yield 3-5%, growing dividend, low payout ratio" → refined

### 2. Use Specific Numbers When Possible

> "P/E under 15" is more precise than "cheap"
> "Market cap over $10 billion" is clearer than "large cap"

### 3. Combine Quality Filters

Good investments often share multiple positive traits:
> "Profitable, growing revenue, low debt, reasonable valuation"

This filters out companies that score well on only one metric.

### 4. Consider What You're Missing

Every screen has blind spots. A "low P/E" screen might miss great growth companies. A "high growth" screen might include overvalued stocks. Be aware of tradeoffs.

### 5. Screen ≠ Buy List

Screening finds candidates for research, not confirmed investments. Always dig deeper before making decisions.

## Troubleshooting

### "No results found"

Your criteria might be too restrictive. Try:
- Relaxing some requirements
- Removing one filter at a time
- Using broader terms

### "Too many results"

Add more criteria to narrow down:
- Add a valuation filter
- Specify market cap range
- Add quality requirements

### "Results don't seem to match"

Try rephrasing your query. The AI interprets natural language, so different wording might work better:
- "Cheap stocks" → "Stocks with P/E under 15"
- "Good companies" → "Companies with ROE over 15% and positive earnings growth"

### "I don't understand a metric in the results"

Click on any metric header for a definition, or ask the AI:
> "What does EV/EBITDA mean?"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from asking the AI to find stocks?

You can ask the AI screener-style questions in chat too! The Vibe Screener provides a more structured interface optimized for screening, with easier result comparison and saving. Both work—use whichever feels more natural.

### How often is screening data updated?

Financial data updates when companies report (quarterly). Price data updates throughout the trading day.

### Can I screen for ETFs?

Yes, the screener includes ETFs. Specify "ETFs only" or include ETF-specific criteria if you want to focus on funds.

### Can I export screening results?

Pro users can export results to CSV. Click **"Export"** after running a screen.

### Why did a stock show up that doesn't seem to match?

The AI interprets natural language, and matches aren't always perfect. Check the "match reason" column for why it was included. If it's clearly wrong, refine your query.
