## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is some data missing for certain stocks?

Data availability varies by company:
- Small caps may have less analyst coverage
- International stocks may have limited data
- Very new IPOs take time to build data history

### What's the difference between the stock page and asking the AI?

The stock page shows structured data at a glance. The AI can explain, analyze, and contextualize that data. Use both—the page for quick reference, the AI for deeper understanding.

### Can I customize what I see on stock pages?

Some display preferences may be adjustable in settings. The core data sections are standard for all users.

### How do I know if data is real-time or delayed?

Pro users see real-time data. Free users see 15-minute delayed data. Check the timestamp near the price for confirmation.
