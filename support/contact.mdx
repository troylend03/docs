## Tips for a Faster Resolution

### Be Specific

**Less helpful:** "The app isn't working"

**More helpful:** "When I try to search for AAPL on iOS, the app freezes and I have to force close it. This started yesterday. I'm on iPhone 14 with app version 2.3.1."

### Include Screenshots

A picture is worth a thousand words, especially for:
- Error messages
- UI issues
- Unexpected behavior
- Billing discrepancies

### One Issue Per Request

If you have multiple unrelated issues, submit separate requests. This helps us route them to the right people and track each to resolution.

### Check Your Spam

Our responses come from @rallies.ai addresses. If you don't hear back, check your spam folder and add us to your contacts.

## Report a Security Issue

If you've found a security vulnerability or believe your account was compromised:

**Email immediately:** security@rallies.ai

Security issues are treated with highest priority. Please include as much detail as possible about the vulnerability or incident.

If you've been charged incorrectly or have an urgent billing matter:

1. Email support@rallies.ai with subject line: **"URGENT: Billing Issue"**
2. Include your account email, the charge date/amount, and what's wrong
3. We prioritize billing issues and aim to respond within 24 hours

For disputes with charges, we recommend also contacting us before disputing with your bank—we can often resolve issues faster.
