# Escalating an Issue

If your issue isn't being resolved through normal support channels, here's how to escalate.

## When to Escalate

Consider escalating when:

- ✓ You've waited longer than the expected response time
- ✓ Your issue has been open for multiple days without resolution
- ✓ The response you received didn't address your problem
- ✓ You've tried the suggested solutions and they didn't work
- ✓ You believe there's been a significant error on our part

## When NOT to Escalate

Escalation isn't appropriate for:

- ✗ Feature requests (these follow a different process)
- ✗ Disagreements with our policies
- ✗ Issues submitted less than 24 hours ago
- ✗ Getting a faster response on non-urgent matters

## How to Escalate

### Step 1: Reply to Your Existing Ticket

1. Find the email thread from your original support request
2. Reply (don't start a new thread)
3. Clearly state:
   - That you'd like to escalate
   - Why the current solution isn't working
   - What outcome you're hoping for

**Example:**
```
Hi,

I'd like to escalate this issue. The solution provided
didn't resolve my problem because [reason]. I've been
unable to [describe impact] for [X] days now.

I'm hoping to [desired outcome].

Thank you.
```

### Step 2: Include Your Ticket Number

Always reference your ticket/case number (found in previous emails) so we can quickly locate your history.

### Step 3: Wait for Escalation Response

Escalated issues are reviewed by a senior team member. You should hear back within:

- **Pro subscribers:** 24 hours
- **Free tier:** 48 hours

## What Happens During Escalation

1. **Review:** A senior support member reviews your entire case history
2. **Investigation:** They may dig deeper into technical issues
3. **Decision:** They determine the appropriate resolution
4. **Response:** You receive a response with next steps or resolution

## Escalation Outcomes

Depending on your issue, escalation may result in:

- **Further troubleshooting** with advanced technical steps
- **Bug confirmation** and timeline for a fix
- **Policy exception** in special circumstances
- **Refund or credit** if appropriate
- **Explanation** if the original response was correct

## If Escalation Doesn't Help

If you're still not satisfied after escalation:

1. **Reply again** explaining what's still unresolved
2. **Request manager review** for billing disputes
3. **Consider alternative solutions** we may have suggested

### For Billing Disputes

If you believe you've been incorrectly charged and support hasn't helped:

1. You have the right to dispute through your credit card company
2. However, we prefer to resolve issues directly
3. Contact us first with "Billing Dispute" in your subject line

## Response Time After Escalation

| Subscriber | Escalation Response |
|------------|---------------------|
| Pro | Within 24 hours |
| Free | Within 48 hours |

## Tips for Effective Escalation

### Do:
- Stay calm and professional
- Be specific about the problem and desired outcome
- Include relevant details and screenshots
- Reference your ticket number

### Don't:
- Use aggressive language
- Make threats
- Submit multiple escalations for the same issue
- Escalate before giving initial support time to respond
