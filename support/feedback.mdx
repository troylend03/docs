# Providing Feedback & Suggestions

Your feedback helps us build a better product. Here's how to share your ideas and suggestions with the Rallies team.

## Ways to Share Feedback

### In-App Feedback

The quickest way to share feedback:

1. Click the **"?"** or **"Feedback"** button (usually bottom-right)
2. Select **"Share Feedback"** or **"Suggest a Feature"**
3. Write your feedback
4. Click **"Submit"**

### Contact Support

For detailed feedback:

1. Go to [support](/support/contact)
2. Select **"Feedback/Suggestion"** as the topic
3. Describe your idea in detail
4. Submit

### Email

Send feedback directly to our team:
- **feedback@rallies.ai** (if available)
- Or use the support contact form

## What Makes Good Feedback

### Be Specific

**Less helpful:**
> "The screener should be better"

**More helpful:**
> "I'd like to filter stocks by PEG ratio in the screener. This would help me find growth stocks at reasonable valuations."

### Explain the Problem

Tell us:
- What you're trying to do
- What's not working or missing
- How it affects your workflow

### Suggest a Solution (Optional)

If you have an idea for how to fix it, share it! But don't worry if you don't—just describing the problem is valuable.

## Types of Feedback We Love

### Feature Requests
- New capabilities you'd like to see
- Existing features that could be improved
- Integrations with other tools

### Usability Feedback
- Confusing interfaces
- Steps that take too many clicks
- Information that's hard to find

### Data Requests
- Stocks or markets not covered
- Data points you wish we had
- Faster update frequencies

### Content Feedback
- Topics the AI could explain better
- Educational content you'd like
- Documentation improvements

## How We Handle Feedback

1. **We read everything** - Every piece of feedback is reviewed by our team
2. **We categorize and track** - Similar requests are grouped together
3. **We prioritize** - Based on user need and feasibility
4. **We build** - Popular and impactful requests get built
5. **We update** - When we ship your idea, we may let you know

## Feedback We Can't Implement

Some requests aren't possible:

- **Personalized investment advice** - We're not financial advisors
- **Guaranteed stock picks** - No one can predict the market
- **Features that violate regulations** - We must comply with financial laws
- **Support for every broker** - We partner where we can

We still appreciate hearing these requests—it helps us understand user needs.

## Bug Reports vs. Feedback

| Bug Report | Feedback/Suggestion |
|------------|---------------------|
| Something is broken | Something could be better |
| "The chart won't load" | "I wish the chart showed more data" |
| Error messages appearing | New feature idea |
| Data is incorrect | Enhancement to existing feature |

For bugs, include:
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Screenshots if possible

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will you respond to my feedback?

We read all feedback but can't respond to every submission. For questions requiring a response, use the support contact form.

### How long until my feature request is built?

It depends on complexity and prioritization. Some requests ship in weeks, others take longer. We can't provide timelines for individual requests.

### Can I vote on feature requests?

We're considering a public feature voting system. For now, more people requesting the same thing helps prioritize it.

### Do you pay for feedback?

We don't have a formal paid feedback program, but we deeply value and appreciate all user input.
