# AI Isn't Responding

If the AI Research Assistant isn't responding, is stuck loading, or giving error messages, here's how to get it working again.

## Quick Fixes

Try these first—they solve most issues:

### 1. Refresh and Try Again

**On Web:**
- Refresh the page (`Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R`)
- Try asking your question again

**On Mobile:**
- Close and reopen the app
- Start a new chat

### 2. Check Your Internet Connection

The AI requires an internet connection:
- Try loading another website or app
- Switch from WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)
- If your connection is slow, responses may time out

### 3. Start a New Conversation

If one chat is stuck:
- Click **"New Chat"** or **"+"** to start fresh
- Sometimes a specific conversation gets stuck, but a new one works fine

### 4. Wait a Moment

During high-traffic periods:
- The AI may take longer to respond
- Wait 30 seconds before refreshing
- Try again in a few minutes if it's still slow

## Specific Issues

### Spinner Keeps Spinning (No Response)

The AI is trying to respond but nothing appears:

1. **Wait up to 60 seconds** — Complex questions take longer
2. **Check your connection** — Responses stream in real-time; poor connectivity interrupts this
3. **Refresh and retry** — The request may have timed out
4. **Simplify your question** — Very complex questions can timeout; try breaking into smaller parts

### "Something Went Wrong" Error

A general error message:

1. **Refresh the page/app**
2. **Try again** — Often a temporary glitch
3. **Check if you're signed in** — Session may have expired
4. **Clear cache** — Old cached data can cause issues
5. **Try a different browser** — Rule out browser-specific problems

### "Unable to Process" or Similar

The AI couldn't handle your request:

1. **Rephrase your question** — Different wording may work better
2. **Ask something simpler first** — Verify the AI is working at all
3. **Check for special characters** — Unusual symbols can sometimes cause issues
4. **Avoid very long inputs** — Extremely long questions may fail

### AI Response Cuts Off Mid-Sentence

The response starts but stops incomplete:

1. **Say "continue"** — The AI may pick up where it left off
2. **Refresh and ask again** — Streaming may have been interrupted
3. **Check your connection** — Unstable connections cause cutoffs
4. **Try a shorter question** — Long responses are more likely to cut off

### Response Takes Forever

AI is responding but very slowly:

1. **Check your connection speed** — Slow internet = slow responses
2. **Wait patiently** — Complex analysis takes time (especially Deep Research)
3. **Try during off-peak hours** — High traffic periods may be slower
4. **Simplify your request** — Asking for less data = faster response

### AI Gives Nonsense or Irrelevant Answers

The AI responds, but the answer doesn't make sense:

1. **Rephrase more clearly** — The AI may have misunderstood
2. **Provide context** — "For AAPL, what is..." is clearer than "What is..."
3. **Ask one thing at a time** — Multi-part questions can confuse
4. **Start a new chat** — Context from earlier may be causing confusion

## Check if It's a Widespread Issue

### Rallies Status

If many people are having issues:
- Check our [status page](https://status.rallies.ai) for known outages
- Check [@RalliesAI on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RalliesAI) for announcements

### Test Basic Functionality

Ask something simple like:
> "What does AAPL do?"

If this works but complex questions don't, the issue is with specific requests, not the AI system overall.

## Browser-Specific Fixes

### Clear Cache and Cookies

**Chrome:**
1. `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear and refresh

**Safari:**
1. Safari → Settings → Privacy
2. Manage Website Data → Remove rallies data

**Firefox:**
1. `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Clear cache
3. Refresh

### Disable Extensions

Ad blockers and privacy extensions can interfere:

1. Open an **incognito/private window** (extensions disabled by default)
2. Go to rallies.ai and sign in
3. Test the AI
4. If it works, an extension is the problem
5. Disable extensions one by one to find the culprit

### Try a Different Browser

If one browser has issues:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Test in another to isolate the problem.

## Mobile App Fixes

### Force Close and Reopen

**iOS:**
1. Swipe up from bottom, pause
2. Find Rallies in app switcher
3. Swipe up to close
4. Reopen

**Android:**
1. Open Recent Apps
2. Swipe Rallies away
3. Reopen

### Clear App Cache (Android)

1. Settings → Apps → Rallies
2. Storage → Clear Cache
3. Reopen app

### Update the App

Outdated app versions may have bugs:
- iOS: App Store → Updates
- Android: Play Store → My apps

### Reinstall

If nothing else works:
1. Delete the Rallies app
2. Reinstall from App Store/Play Store
3. Sign back in

Your data is saved in the cloud—reinstalling won't lose anything.

## Rate Limits (Free Tier)

If you're on the Free tier, you have a weekly limit on AI queries.

### Check If You've Hit Your Limit

- You'll see a message about query limits
- The limit resets every Monday

### What To Do

- Wait until your limit resets
- [Upgrade to Pro](/billing/upgrade) for unlimited queries
