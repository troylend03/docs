# I Can't Log In to My Account

Can't access your Rallies account? This guide covers the most common login issues and how to fix them. Most problems can be resolved in a few minutes.

## Quick Fixes to Try First

Before diving into specific issues, try these steps:

1. **Double-check your email address** - Typos happen. Make sure it's exactly right.
2. **Check Caps Lock** - Passwords are case-sensitive.
3. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser issues cause login problems.
4. **Clear your browser cache** - Old cached data can interfere with login.
5. **Disable browser extensions** - Ad blockers or privacy extensions sometimes block login.

## Find Your Issue Below

### "Incorrect email or password"

This error means either the email isn't registered or the password is wrong.

**If you're sure the email is correct:**

1. Click **"Forgot password?"** on the login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your inbox for a reset link (also check spam)
4. Create a new password
5. Try logging in again

[Detailed password reset guide →](/account/reset-password)

**If you're not sure which email you used:**

- Try other email addresses you commonly use
- Check your email inboxes for past messages from Rallies (search "Rallies")
- If you signed up with Google or Apple, try those login options

### "No account found with this email"

This means the email address isn't registered in our system.

**Possible reasons:**

- You signed up with a different email address
- You signed up using Google or Apple (not email)
- You haven't created an account yet

**What to try:**

1. Try signing in with **"Continue with Google"** or **"Continue with Apple"**
2. Try other email addresses you might have used
3. If you're new, [create an account →](/getting-started/create-account)

### Google Sign-In Not Working

If "Continue with Google" isn't working:

**The button doesn't respond:**
- Enable pop-ups in your browser (Google login opens a pop-up)
- Disable ad blockers temporarily
- Try a different browser (Chrome usually works best with Google sign-in)

**"Access blocked" or security error:**
- Your Google account security settings may be blocking third-party sign-ins
- Go to your [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and check for any alerts
- Try signing in from a device you've used before

**Wrong Google account signing in:**
- If you have multiple Google accounts, you might be clicking the wrong one
- Sign out of all Google accounts, then try again and carefully select the right one
- Use an incognito/private window to get a fresh login prompt

### Apple Sign-In Not Working

If "Continue with Apple" isn't working:

**On web:**
- Make sure pop-ups are enabled
- Try using Safari (best compatibility with Apple sign-in)
- Check that you're signed into your Apple ID

**On iOS:**
- Make sure Face ID or Touch ID is working
- Go to Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-In & Security and verify your Apple ID is active
- Try restarting your device

**"Hide My Email" issues:**
- If you chose "Hide My Email" when signing up, you're using an Apple relay address
- You can't log in with your real email—you must use "Continue with Apple"
- Check your Apple ID settings to see your relay addresses: Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Hide My Email

### Two-Factor Authentication Issues

If you have 2FA enabled and can't get in:

**Not receiving the code:**
- Check that you're looking at the right phone/authenticator app
- If using SMS, check for carrier delays (wait a minute and try again)
- Make sure your phone number is current in your account settings

**Lost access to your authenticator app:**
- If you saved backup codes when setting up 2FA, use one of those
- If you don't have backup codes, [contact support](/support/contact) with proof of account ownership

### Account Locked or Suspended

If you see a message that your account is locked:

**Too many failed login attempts:**
- Wait 15-30 minutes and try again
- Use "Forgot password?" to reset your password
- This is a security measure to protect your account

**Account suspended:**
- Check your email for a message from Rallies explaining why
- [Contact support](/support/contact) to resolve the issue

### Mobile App Login Issues

**App won't accept my credentials:**
- Make sure you're using the latest version of the app (update if needed)
- Try logging in on the web first to verify your credentials work
- Force-close the app and reopen it

**"Session expired" errors:**
- Sign out completely, then sign back in
- If it keeps happening, reinstall the app

**Biometric login (Face ID/Touch ID) not working:**
- Go to app settings and disable then re-enable biometric login
- Make sure biometrics are enabled in your device settings
- Try signing in with your password first, then re-enable biometrics

### Browser-Specific Issues

**Safari:**
- Go to Safari > Settings > Privacy and uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking"
- Clear website data for rallies.ai

**Chrome:**
- Clear cache and cookies: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
- Disable extensions one by one to find if one is blocking login

**Firefox:**
- Check that Enhanced Tracking Protection isn't blocking rallies.ai
- Try with strict mode disabled

**Brave:**
- Shields may block login functionality
- Click the Brave icon in the address bar and lower shield settings for rallies.ai

## Still Can't Log In?

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have multiple accounts with different emails?

Yes, but each email address creates a separate account. If you accidentally created two accounts, contact support to merge them.

### What if I no longer have access to my email?

Contact support with as much account information as possible (name, when you signed up, connected brokerage if any). We can help verify your identity through other means.

### Will I lose my data if I reset my password?

No. Resetting your password doesn't affect your watchlists, portfolios, chat history, or any other data.

### Why does it say I have an account but Google/Apple login doesn't work?

You may have created your account with email originally, then tried to log in with social. These are treated as separate accounts. Try logging in with your email and password instead, or use "Forgot password?" to reset.
