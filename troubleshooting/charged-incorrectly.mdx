# I Was Charged Incorrectly

If you see a charge from Rallies that seems wrong, we want to help you understand and resolve it quickly. Most billing concerns have simple explanations, but if there's a genuine error, we'll make it right.

## First: Identify the Charge

Let's figure out what the charge is for.

### Check Your Subscription Status

1. Go to **Settings → Subscription**
2. Look at:
   - Your current plan (Free or Pro)
   - Billing cycle (monthly or annual)
   - Last payment date
   - Next renewal date

### Common Charge Amounts

| Amount | Likely Source |
|--------|---------------|
| $19.00 | Pro Monthly subscription |
| $99.00 | Pro Annual subscription |
| $19 + tax | Pro Monthly with sales tax |
| $99 + tax | Pro Annual with sales tax |

If your charge matches one of these, it's likely a legitimate subscription charge.

## Common Billing Concerns

### "I was charged but I thought I had a free trial"

**Possible explanations:**
- Your 7-day trial ended and converted to a paid subscription
- You'll receive an email notification when trials end
- If you meant to cancel before the trial ended, see our [refund policy](/billing/refund-policy)

**Check:** Look at your subscription start date in Settings. If it's more than 7 days ago, your trial has ended.

### "I was charged twice"

**Possible explanations:**
- One charge is a pending authorization (not final), and one is the actual charge
- You have two separate accounts that are both subscribed
- Genuine duplicate charge (we'll refund this)

**Check:** 
1. Wait 24-48 hours—pending authorizations often disappear
2. Check if you have multiple Rallies accounts (different emails)
3. If both charges post permanently, [contact us](/support/contact) for a refund

### "I was charged after I cancelled"

**Possible explanations:**
- The charge was for your final billing period (you keep access until it ends)
- The cancellation didn't process correctly
- You cancelled after your renewal date

**Check:**
1. Verify cancellation confirmation email exists
2. Check Settings → Subscription for cancellation status
3. If you were charged after a confirmed cancellation, [contact us](/support/contact) for a refund

### "The amount is different than I expected"

**Possible explanations:**
- Sales tax or VAT was added based on your location
- You're on a different billing cycle than you thought (monthly vs annual)
- A promotional discount ended

**Check:** Look at your invoice in Settings → Subscription → Billing History. It will show the breakdown including any taxes.

### "I don't recognize this charge at all"

**Possible explanations:**
- A family member signed up using your card
- You signed up during a trial and forgot
- The charge is from another company (not Rallies)

**Check:**
1. Search your email for "Rallies" or "welcome" to find signup confirmation
2. The charge will appear as "Rallies" or "Blotter Inc" on your statement
3. If it's truly not from us, contact your bank—it may be fraud unrelated to Rallies

### "I was charged the wrong amount"

**Possible explanations:**
- Tax was added to the base price
- Currency conversion fees (if your card is non-USD)
- You're on annual and expected monthly (or vice versa)

**Check:** Your invoice will show the exact breakdown. If the math doesn't add up, [contact us](/support/contact).

## Preventing Future Issues

### Know Your Renewal Date

Check Settings → Subscription to see when you'll be charged next. Set a calendar reminder if you're considering canceling.

### Keep Payment Info Updated

Expired cards can cause billing confusion. Update your card before it expires.

### Check Emails from Rallies

We send receipts after every charge and reminders before renewals. Check your inbox (and spam folder) for these notifications.

### Understand Your Plan

Know whether you're on monthly ($19) or annual ($99) billing. Annual is a bigger upfront charge but much better value.

If you file a chargeback with your bank, your account may be suspended during the investigation. We recommend contacting us first—we can usually resolve issues immediately.
