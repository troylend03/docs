# Data Isn't Loading or Updating

If stock prices, portfolio data, or other information seems stuck or won't load, this guide will help you troubleshoot and fix the issue.

## Quick Fixes

Try these first—they resolve most data loading issues:

### 1. Refresh the Page/App

**On Web:**
- Press `Ctrl + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + R` (Mac)
- Or click the browser refresh button

**On Mobile:**
- Pull down on the screen to refresh
- Or close and reopen the app

### 2. Check Your Internet Connection

- Try loading another website or app
- If other sites work, the issue is specific to Rallies
- Try switching from WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)

### 3. Wait a Moment

- Brief data delays can occur during high market activity
- Wait 30 seconds and refresh again
- If markets just opened, initial data may take a moment

## Specific Data Issues

### Prices Not Updating

**If prices seem frozen:**

1. **Check market hours**
   - US markets: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Mon-Fri
   - Prices don't change when markets are closed
   - After-hours prices may not display on all views

2. **Check your plan**
   - **Free:** 15-minute delayed quotes
   - **Pro:** Real-time quotes
   - If on Free, prices update every 15 minutes, not in real-time

3. **Look at the timestamp**
   - Check when data was last updated
   - If timestamp is old, try refreshing

4. **Clear cache and refresh**
   - Web: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Mobile: Close app fully and reopen

### Portfolio Not Syncing

**If connected portfolio data is outdated:**

1. **Force a manual sync**
   - Go to Portfolio
   - Click/tap the refresh or "Sync" button
   - Wait for sync to complete

2. **Check connection status**
   - Go to Settings → Connected Accounts
   - Verify your brokerage shows as "Connected"
   - If disconnected, reconnect your brokerage

3. **Understand sync timing**
   - Portfolios sync multiple times per day but not instantly
   - New trades may take hours to appear
   - Very recent activity might not show yet

4. **Reconnect if needed**
   - Disconnect and reconnect your brokerage
   - This refreshes the connection and re-syncs data

### Charts Not Loading

**If price charts show blank or won't display:**

1. **Try a different timeframe**
   - Click 1D, 1W, 1M to switch views
   - Sometimes one timeframe loads while another doesn't

2. **Disable browser extensions**
   - Ad blockers can interfere with charts
   - Try in incognito/private mode

3. **Check JavaScript**
   - Charts require JavaScript
   - Ensure it's enabled in your browser

4. **Try a different browser**
   - Some browsers render charts better than others
   - Chrome typically has best compatibility

### Watchlist Prices Stale

**If watchlist prices aren't updating:**

1. **Refresh the watchlist page**
   - Pull to refresh on mobile
   - Refresh button on web

2. **Check your plan**
   - Free tier has 15-minute delayed data
   - Prices may seem stale but are actually on delay schedule

3. **Clear app cache (mobile)**
   - iOS: Delete and reinstall app
   - Android: Settings → Apps → Rallies → Clear Cache

### Financial Data Seems Wrong

**If financial statements or metrics look incorrect:**

1. **Check the data date**
   - Financials update quarterly
   - Look for "as of" date to see which period is shown

2. **Verify the source**
   - Compare with official filings if concerned
   - SEC EDGAR has official company filings

3. **Report the issue**
   - If data is genuinely incorrect, [contact support](/support/contact)
   - Include the ticker, data point, and what you believe is wrong

### News Not Loading

**If news section is empty or outdated:**

1. **Refresh the page**
   - News feeds can have brief delays

2. **Check the company**
   - Smaller companies may have less news coverage
   - Not all stocks have frequent news

3. **Check your connection**
   - News requires a stable internet connection

## App-Specific Fixes

### Web Browser

**Clear cache:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Clear and refresh Rallies

**Try incognito mode:**
1. Open incognito/private window
2. Go to rallies.ai and sign in
3. If it works, a browser extension is likely the issue

### iOS App

**Force close and reopen:**
1. Swipe up from bottom, pause on app switcher
2. Swipe Rallies away to close
3. Reopen from home screen

**Clear cache:**
1. Delete the Rallies app
2. Reinstall from App Store
3. Sign back in (your data is saved in the cloud)

### Android App

**Clear app cache:**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Rallies
2. Tap Storage → Clear Cache
3. Reopen the app

**Force stop:**
1. Settings → Apps → Rallies
2. Tap Force Stop
3. Reopen the app

## When Data Issues Are Expected

Sometimes "missing" data is actually normal:

### Outside Market Hours

- Stock prices don't change when markets are closed
- Weekend prices show Friday's close
- After-hours/pre-market data may be limited

### 15-Minute Delay (Free Tier)

- If you're on Free, data is delayed by 15 minutes
- This is not a bug—it's the free tier data policy
- Upgrade to Pro for real-time data

### Newly Added Stocks

- If you just added a stock, give it a moment to load data
- Some data (like financials) may take longer to populate

### Recent IPOs

- Very new public companies may have limited data
- Historical financials build up over time

### International Stocks

- Coverage varies by market
- Some data may be less comprehensive than US stocks

## Check Rallies Status

If many features aren't working:

1. Visit our [status page](https://status.rallies.ai) (if available)
2. Check [@RalliesAI on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RalliesAI) for announcements
3. If there's an outage, we're working on it

## Still Having Issues?

If none of the above helps:

**Contact support with:**

- What device and browser/app version you're using
- When the issue started
- Screenshots if possible
- What you've already tried

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are prices different from my brokerage?

- Free tier has 15-minute delay
- Different data providers can have slight variations
- After-hours prices may display differently

### How often does portfolio data sync?

Multiple times per day, but not in real-time. For immediate accuracy, check your actual brokerage app.

### Why does financial data still show last quarter?
