# I'm Not Receiving Emails from Rallies

If you're not getting emails from Rallies—whether it's verification emails, price alerts, receipts, or newsletters—this guide will help you fix the problem.

## Quick Checklist

Try these steps first:

- [ ] Check your spam/junk folder
- [ ] Check Gmail's Promotions tab (if using Gmail)
- [ ] Verify your email address is correct in Settings
- [ ] Make sure email notifications are enabled
- [ ] Add hello@rallies.ai to your contacts

## Step 1: Check Spam and Filtered Folders

Most "missing" emails are actually delivered—just filtered somewhere unexpected.

### Gmail
Check these tabs/folders:
- **Spam** - Main spam folder
- **Promotions** - Gmail often puts marketing emails here
- **Updates** - Transactional emails sometimes land here
- **All Mail** - Search here to find emails regardless of folder

**Search tip:** Type `from:rallies.ai` in Gmail search to find all Rallies emails.

### Outlook / Hotmail
Check these folders:
- **Junk Email**
- **Focused vs. Other** - Switch to "Other" inbox to check
- **Deleted Items** - In case of aggressive filtering

### Yahoo Mail
Check:
- **Spam**
- **Bulk Mail**

### Apple Mail (iCloud)
Check:
- **Junk**
- **Archive** - Sometimes emails get auto-archived

### Corporate/School Email
Work and school emails often have strict filtering:
- Check your quarantine folder (if your organization has one)
- Ask your IT department if emails from @rallies.ai are being blocked
- Consider using a personal email address instead

## Step 2: Add Rallies to Your Contacts

Adding our email addresses to your contacts tells your email provider we're legitimate.

**Add these addresses:**
- hello@rallies.ai (general communications)
- alerts@rallies.ai (price alerts and notifications)
- billing@rallies.ai (receipts and subscription emails)
- noreply@rallies.ai (system emails)

### How to add contacts:

1. Click the People icon
2. Click "New contact"
3. Add the email addresses

**Apple Mail:**

## Step 4: Check Your Notification Settings

You might have email notifications turned off.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Make sure **Email notifications** is toggled ON
3. Check individual notification types:
   - Price alerts
   - Earnings notifications
   - Weekly digest
   - Product updates

If everything looks enabled but you're still not receiving emails, continue to the next steps.

## Step 5: Whitelist Rallies (Advanced)

3. Click **Create a new filter**
4. In "From" enter: `@rallies.ai`
5. Click **Create filter**
6. Check **Never send it to Spam**
7. Click **Create filter**

### Outlook Whitelist

1. Go to **Settings** → **View all Outlook settings**
2. Select **Mail** → **Junk email**
3. Under "Safe senders and domains," click **Add**
4. Enter: `rallies.ai`
5. Click **Save**

### Corporate Email

If you use work email, you may need to ask IT to:
- Whitelist the domain rallies.ai

- Make sure the alert conditions have actually been triggered
- [More about alert issues →](/watchlists/why-no-alert)

### Receipts and Billing Emails

Not receiving payment confirmations?
- Check spam (billing emails often get filtered)
- Verify the email on your account matches where you're looking

## Test Your Email Delivery

Want to confirm emails are working?

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Look for **"Send test email"** button (if available)
3. Click it and check your inbox

Or:

1. Set a price alert on a stock close to its current price
2. Wait for it to trigger
3. Check if you receive the alert email

## If You're Using Apple's "Hide My Email"

If you signed up using "Sign in with Apple" and chose "Hide My Email":

- Apple created a private relay address (something like xyz123@privaterelay.appleid.com)
- Emails are sent to this address, then forwarded to your real inbox
- This forwarding can sometimes fail or be delayed

**To check your relay address:**
1. On iPhone: Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Hide My Email
2. Find the relay address for Rallies
3. Make sure forwarding is enabled

**If relay forwarding isn't working:**
- You can disable Hide My Email for Rallies and update to your real email in Rallies settings
- Or contact Apple support about relay issues

## Still Not Receiving Emails?

If you've tried everything above:

**Contact support with:**
- Your account email address
- What type of emails you're not receiving
- Your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Confirmation that you've checked spam/filtered folders
- Any error messages you've seen

[Contact Support →](/support/contact)

We can check our email logs to see if messages are being sent successfully, and help troubleshoot further.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I wait for emails to arrive?

Most emails arrive within 1-5 minutes. Verification and password reset emails may take up to 10 minutes. If you haven't received anything after 15 minutes, it's likely a filtering or delivery issue.

### Can I change which email address receives notifications?

Yes, update your email address in Settings → Account. All notifications will go to your new address after you verify it.

### Do email settings sync between web and mobile app?

Yes, your notification preferences are account-wide. Changing them in one place changes them everywhere.

### Why am I getting some emails but not others?

Different email types (transactional, alerts, marketing) come from different sending addresses and may be filtered differently. Check your notification settings to make sure each type is enabled.
