# The Page Won't Load / Blank Screen

If Rallies isn't loading properly—showing a blank screen, spinning forever, or displaying errors—try these fixes in order.

## Quick Fixes (Try These First)

### 1. Refresh the Page

**On web:**
- Press `Ctrl + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + R` (Mac)
- Or click the refresh button in your browser

**On mobile:**
- Pull down on the screen to refresh
- Or close and reopen the app

### 2. Check Your Internet Connection

Make sure you're connected to the internet:
- Try loading another website (like google.com)
- If other sites don't work, the issue is your connection, not Rallies
- Try switching from WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)

### 3. Check Rallies Status

We might be experiencing an outage:
- Visit our [status page](https://status.rallies.ai) (if available)
- Check [@RalliesAI on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/RalliesAI) for announcements
- If there's an outage, we're working on it—check back shortly

## Browser Troubleshooting (Web)

If quick fixes didn't work, try these browser-specific solutions:

### Clear Your Browser Cache

Cached data can cause loading issues. Here's how to clear it:

**Chrome:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "All time" for time range
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Reload Rallies

**Safari:**
1. Go to Safari → Settings → Privacy
2. Click "Manage Website Data"
3. Search for "rallies" and remove
4. Or click "Remove All"
5. Reload Rallies

**Firefox:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. Select "Everything" for time range
3. Check "Cache"
4. Click "Clear Now"
5. Reload Rallies

**Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear now"
5. Reload Rallies

### Try Hard Refresh

A hard refresh forces your browser to reload everything from scratch:

- **Chrome/Edge (Windows):** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Chrome/Edge (Mac):** `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Safari:** `Cmd + Option + R`
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Cmd + Shift + R`

### Disable Browser Extensions

Extensions (especially ad blockers, privacy tools, or VPNs) can interfere with Rallies.

**Quick test:** Open an incognito/private window (which disables extensions) and try loading Rallies.
- If it works in incognito, an extension is the problem
- Disable extensions one by one to find the culprit

**Common problematic extensions:**
- Ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus)
- Privacy extensions (Privacy Badger, Ghostery)
- VPN extensions
- JavaScript blockers

You may need to whitelist rallies.ai in your ad blocker or security extension.

### Try a Different Browser

If one browser isn't working, try another:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

If Rallies works in a different browser, the issue is specific to your original browser's settings or extensions.

### Check JavaScript is Enabled

Rallies requires JavaScript to run. Make sure it's not disabled:

**Chrome:** Settings → Privacy and Security → Site Settings → JavaScript → Allowed

**Safari:** Settings → Security → Enable JavaScript (checked)

**Firefox:** Type `about:config` in address bar, search for `javascript.enabled`, ensure it's `true`

## Mobile App Troubleshooting

### Force Close and Reopen

**iOS:**
1. Swipe up from bottom and pause (or double-click home button)
2. Find Rallies in the app switcher
3. Swipe up on Rallies to close it
4. Reopen the app from your home screen

**Android:**
1. Open Recent Apps (square button or swipe up and hold)
2. Find Rallies
3. Swipe it away to close
4. Reopen from your app drawer

### Clear App Cache (Android)

1. Go to Settings → Apps → Rallies
2. Tap "Storage"
3. Tap "Clear Cache"
4. Reopen the app

### Update the App

Outdated apps can have loading issues:

**iOS:** Open App Store → Your profile → Check for Rallies update

**Android:** Open Play Store → Menu → My apps → Check for Rallies update

### Reinstall the App

If nothing else works:

1. Delete the Rallies app
2. Restart your phone
3. Reinstall from App Store or Play Store
4. Sign in again

Your data is stored in the cloud—reinstalling won't delete your watchlists or portfolios.

### Check Available Storage

If your phone is nearly full, apps may not load properly:

**iOS:** Settings → General → iPhone Storage

**Android:** Settings → Storage

Free up space if you're running low.

## Specific Loading Issues

### Blank White Screen

Usually caused by:
- JavaScript errors (try clearing cache)
- Browser extension conflicts (try incognito mode)
- Outdated browser (update your browser)

### Infinite Loading Spinner

Usually caused by:
- Slow internet connection
- Server issues (check status page)
- Large data load (try refreshing)

### "Something Went Wrong" Error

Usually caused by:
- Temporary server issue (wait and retry)
- Session expired (sign out and back in)
- Browser cache issue (clear cache)

### Page Loads But Features Don't Work

Usually caused by:
- JavaScript blocked by extension
- Partial cache issue (hard refresh)

## Network Issues

### Behind a Firewall or Corporate Network

Some corporate networks block certain sites or features:
- Try using your phone's mobile data instead of company WiFi
- Ask IT if rallies.ai is blocked
- Try accessing from home or a different network

### VPN Issues

VPNs can sometimes cause loading problems:
- Try disconnecting your VPN temporarily
- Try connecting to a different VPN server
- Some VPNs have "split tunneling" to exclude certain sites

### DNS Issues

Occasionally DNS problems prevent sites from loading:
- Try using Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
- Flush your DNS cache:
  - **Windows:** Open CMD, type `ipconfig /flushdns`
  - **Mac:** Open Terminal, type `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`

## Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything above and Rallies still won't load:

**Gather this information:**
- What device and browser/app version you're using
- What you see (blank screen, error message, spinner)
- When the issue started
- What you've already tried
- Screenshots of any error messages

**Contact support:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Rallies down right now?

Check our [status page](https://status.rallies.ai) or [@RalliesAI on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RalliesAI). If there's an outage, we post updates there.

### Will I lose my data if I reinstall the app?

No. Your watchlists, portfolios, and settings are stored in the cloud. Reinstalling the app and signing back in will restore everything.

### The website works but the app doesn't (or vice versa)

This points to a platform-specific issue. For app problems, try updating or reinstalling. For web problems, try clearing cache or a different browser. If only one platform works, use that while we investigate.

### It was working earlier today. What changed?

Possible causes:
- We deployed an update (temporary issues sometimes occur)
- Your browser/app cached something incorrectly
- Your network configuration changed
- A browser extension updated

Try clearing your cache first—this fixes most "it was working before" issues.
