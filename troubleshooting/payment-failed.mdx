# Payment Failed / Card Declined

If your payment failed or your card was declined, don't worry—this is usually easy to fix. Here's how to resolve it and keep your Pro subscription active.

## Why Payments Fail

Common reasons for declined payments:

| Reason | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| **Expired card** | Update to your new card |
| **Insufficient funds** | Add funds or use different card |
| **Incorrect card details** | Re-enter card number, expiration, CVC |
| **Bank security block** | Contact your bank to approve |
| **International transaction block** | Contact bank or use different card |
| **Card reported lost/stolen** | Use your replacement card |
| **Billing address mismatch** | Update ZIP code to match card |
| **Daily/monthly spending limit** | Contact bank or use different card |

## How to Fix It

### Step 1: Check Your Card Details

Often the fix is simply re-entering your card information:

1. Go to **Settings → Subscription**
2. Click **"Update Payment Method"**
3. Carefully re-enter:
   - Card number (no spaces or dashes)
   - Expiration date (MM/YY)
   - CVC (3 or 4 digit code on back of card)
   - Billing ZIP code (must match your card's billing address)
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Try the payment again

### Step 2: Check Your Card Status

Make sure your card is valid:

- **Not expired:** Check the expiration date printed on your card
- **Not cancelled:** If you reported it lost/stolen, use your new card
- **Has available credit/funds:** Check your balance or credit limit
- **Not frozen:** Some banks let you freeze cards in their app

### Step 3: Contact Your Bank

If your card details are correct but payment still fails, your bank may be blocking the transaction.

Call the number on the back of your card and:
- Ask if they're blocking a charge from "Rallies" or "Blotter Inc"
- Request they approve the transaction
- Ask about any international transaction blocks
- Confirm there are no fraud alerts on your account

After speaking with your bank, try the payment again in Rallies.

### Step 4: Try a Different Card

If your current card won't work:

1. Go to **Settings → Subscription**
2. Click **"Update Payment Method"**
3. Enter a different credit or debit card
4. Save and retry payment

## For iOS App Store Subscriptions

If you subscribed through iOS and payment failed:

1. Open **Settings** on your iPhone
2. Tap your **name** at the top
3. Tap **"Payment & Shipping"**
4. Update your payment method or add a new one
5. Apple will automatically retry the charge

You may also see a prompt in the App Store to update payment.

## For Google Play Subscriptions

If you subscribed through Android and payment failed:

1. Open **Google Play Store**
2. Tap your **profile icon → Payments & subscriptions**
3. Tap **"Payment methods"**
4. Update or add a new payment method
5. Google will retry the charge

## What Happens When Payment Fails

### Grace Period

When a payment fails:

1. **We retry automatically** - Payment is attempted again over several days
2. **You'll receive email notifications** - We'll alert you about the failed payment
3. **Pro access continues temporarily** - You have a brief grace period to fix the issue
4. **If not resolved** - Your account eventually downgrades to Free

### Timeline

| Day | What Happens |
|-----|--------------|
| Day 0 | Payment fails, first retry attempted |
| Day 1-3 | Additional retries, email notifications sent |
| Day 3-7 | Final retry attempts |
| Day 7+ | Account may downgrade to Free if unresolved |

The exact timeline varies, but you generally have about a week to update your payment before losing Pro access.

### After Downgrade

If your account is downgraded due to payment failure:

- Your data is NOT deleted (watchlists, portfolios, chat history remain)
- You move to Free tier limits
- Update your payment method anytime to reactivate Pro immediately

## Specific Error Messages

### "Card declined"

Your bank refused the charge. This is usually:
- Security block (contact your bank)
- Insufficient funds
- Expired card
- Incorrect details

### "Invalid card number"

The card number is incorrect. Double-check you entered all digits correctly with no typos.

### "Invalid expiration date"

Check the date on your physical card. Enter as MM/YY (e.g., 03/27 for March 2027).

### "Invalid CVC"

The security code is wrong. It's the 3-digit code on the back of Visa/Mastercard/Discover, or 4-digit code on the front of Amex.

### "Postal code mismatch"

The ZIP code you entered doesn't match your card's billing address. Enter the ZIP code where your card statements are mailed.

### "Do not honor"

Generic bank refusal. Contact your bank to ask why and request approval.

### "Card not supported"

We may not accept that card type. Try a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover card.

## Preventing Future Payment Failures

1. **Update cards before they expire** - When you get a new card, update it in Rallies immediately
2. **Use a card with sufficient credit/funds** - Ensure your card won't hit limits
3. **Notify your bank about recurring charges** - Some banks are more lenient on known subscriptions
4. **Keep billing address current** - If you move, update your address with your bank and in Rallies
5. **Set a calendar reminder** - Note your card expiration date

## Still Having Issues?

If you've tried everything above and payment still won't process:

**Contact support with:**
- Your account email
- The last 4 digits of the card you're trying to use
- Any error messages you're seeing
- Confirmation that you've contacted your bank

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I lose my data if payment fails?

No. Your watchlists, portfolios, and chat history are never deleted due to payment issues. You may lose Pro feature access, but your data is safe.

### Can I pay with a different method while I sort out my card?

Yes! Update to any valid card to restore service immediately. You can switch back to your preferred card later.

### I was charged but payment still shows as failed?

Sometimes there's a delay between successful payment and system update. Wait 15-30 minutes and refresh. If the charge shows on your bank statement but Rallies still shows failed, [contact support](/support/contact)—we'll sort it out.

### Can I use a prepaid card?

Most prepaid cards work, but some may be declined. If your prepaid card fails, try a traditional credit or debit card.

### My bank says they didn't block anything?

Sometimes blocks happen at the payment processor level. Try re-entering your card details carefully, or try a different card.
