## Tips for Watchlist Management

### Keep Watchlists Focused

Instead of one giant watchlist, create themed lists:
- "Research Queue" — Stocks to investigate
- "Ready to Buy" — Waiting for the right price
- "Watching Earnings" — Companies reporting soon
- "Sold, Still Tracking" — Former holdings you're monitoring

### Regular Cleanup

Periodically review and remove stocks you're no longer interested in. A cleaner watchlist is more useful.

### Use Meaningful Names

Name watchlists so you remember their purpose. "Watchlist 1" is less helpful than "Small Cap Value Ideas."

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the add button"

- On web: Look for "+" or "+ Add Stock" at the top of the watchlist
- On mobile: Look for a "+" floating button or tap the header area

### "Stock won't add"

- Make sure you selected a valid stock from the dropdown
- Check your spelling if typing manually
- Verify the stock exists (some very small or delisted stocks may not be available)

### "I accidentally removed a stock"

Just add it back using any of the methods above. Your removal doesn't delete any data about the stock—you can always re-add it.

### "I hit my watchlist limit"

Free users are limited to 3 watchlists (but unlimited stocks per list). [Upgrade to Pro](/billing/upgrade) for unlimited watchlists.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a limit to how many stocks I can add to one watchlist?

No limit! Add as many stocks as you want to a single watchlist.

### Can I add the same stock to multiple watchlists?

Yes. A stock can be in as many watchlists as you like.

### Will removing a stock delete any data?

No. Removing from a watchlist just stops tracking it there. The stock's data still exists, and any price alerts you set remain active.

### Can I reorder stocks in my watchlist?

Yes, on web you can drag and drop. On mobile, look for sort options or an edit/reorder mode.

### Do changes sync across devices?

Yes. Add a stock on web, and it appears on mobile instantly (and vice versa).
