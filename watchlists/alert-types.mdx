# Types of Price Alerts

Price alerts are your personal market watchers. Understanding the different alert types helps you set up notifications that actually match your trading and investing goals.

## Overview of Alert Types

Rallies offers two core alert types:

| Alert Type | Triggers When | Best For |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Price Above** | Stock rises to or above your target | Breakouts, sell targets, momentum |
| **Price Below** | Stock falls to or below your target | Buy opportunities, stop-loss reminders |

Each serves different purposes in your investment workflow.

## Price Above Alerts

### How It Works

A "Price Above" alert triggers when a stock's price rises to meet or exceed your target price.

**Example:** You set a Price Above alert for AAPL at $200. When Apple's stock reaches $200 or higher during market hours, you receive a notification.

### When to Use Price Above Alerts

**Breakout Monitoring**

You've identified a stock trading in a range, and you want to know when it breaks out.

> NVDA has been stuck between $400-$450 for weeks. Set an alert above $455 to catch the breakout.

**Sell Target Reminders**

You own a stock and have a profit target in mind.

> You bought MSFT at $350 and want to sell at $400. Set an alert at $400 so you don't miss your exit.

**Momentum Confirmation**

You want to buy when a stock shows strength by reaching new highs.

> AMD making new highs would confirm the uptrend. Set an alert above the 52-week high.

**Earnings Reaction Watch**

You want to know if a stock gaps up after earnings.

> GOOGL reports tonight. Set an alert 5% above current price to catch a positive reaction.

### Price Above Examples

| Stock | Current Price | Alert Price | Reason |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| AAPL | $185 | $200 | Round number breakout |
| TSLA | $180 | $195 | Resistance level break |
| NVDA | $450 | $475 | All-time high watch |
| META | $500 | $520 | Sell target reached |

### Tips for Price Above Alerts

**Consider resistance levels:** Set alerts slightly above key resistance, not exactly at round numbers where the price might stall.

**Use for confirmation:** Wait for breakouts before buying momentum stocks, rather than guessing.

**Layer your alerts:** Set multiple price points to track progressive strength.

## Price Below Alerts

### How It Works

A "Price Below" alert triggers when a stock's price falls to or below your target price.

**Example:** You set a Price Below alert for TSLA at $150. When Tesla drops to $150 or lower during market hours, you receive a notification.

### When to Use Price Below Alerts

**Buy Opportunity Alerts**

You want to own a stock but think it's currently too expensive.

> You love AAPL but not at $185. Set an alert at $170 to catch a pullback.

**Support Level Monitoring**

You want to know if a stock breaks below key support.

> MSFT has held $300 support three times. Set an alert at $295 to catch a breakdown.

**Stop-Loss Reminders**

You own a stock and want a warning if it drops to your mental stop level.

> You bought NVDA at $400 with a mental stop at $350. Set an alert at $355 for early warning.

**Dip Buying Opportunities**

You're looking for oversold conditions to add to positions.

> Set alerts at -10%, -15%, and -20% from a stock's peak to catch different dip levels.

**Portfolio Protection**

Monitor your holdings for concerning drops.

> Set alerts 15% below your cost basis on each position as a warning system.

### Price Below Examples

| Stock | Current Price | Alert Price | Reason |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| AAPL | $185 | $170 | Buy on pullback |
| GOOGL | $140 | $125 | Support level test |
| AMZN | $180 | $155 | Aggressive accumulation |
| JPM | $200 | $180 | Value entry point |

### Tips for Price Below Alerts

**Set realistic targets:** A 50% drop alert might never trigger. Be reasonable about what pullbacks you expect.

**Consider support levels:** Set alerts slightly below support to confirm a breakdown, not just a test.

**Use for averaging down:** Layer alerts at different levels if you want to build a position over time.

## Combining Alert Types

Smart alert strategies often use both types together.

### The Range Breakout Setup

When a stock is trading in a defined range, set alerts on both sides.

**Example: TSLA trading between $160-$190**

| Alert Type | Price | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Price Above | $195 | Breakout confirmed |
| Price Below | $155 | Breakdown confirmed |

This tells you which direction the stock resolves, without having to watch constantly.

### The Buy Zone Strategy

You want to buy a stock at good prices, with multiple entry points.

**Example: Building a position in AAPL**

| Alert Type | Price | Action |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Price Below | $175 | Start small position |
| Price Below | $165 | Add to position |
| Price Below | $155 | Add more aggressively |

### The Profit Target Ladder

You own a stock and want to scale out at progressively higher prices.

**Example: Managing NVDA position**

| Alert Type | Price | Action |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Price Above | $500 | Sell 25% |
| Price Above | $550 | Sell another 25% |
| Price Above | $600 | Sell another 25% |

### The Stop-Loss and Target Pair

Set both downside protection and upside target for any position.

**Example: Bought MSFT at $380**

| Alert Type | Price | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Price Below | $350 | Stop-loss warning |
| Price Above | $420 | Take profit target |

## Calculating Alert Prices

### Percentage-Based Targets

While Rallies uses price-based alerts, you can calculate percentage targets:

**Formula:** Target Price = Current Price x (1 + Percentage)

**Examples:**

| Current Price | Percentage | Calculation | Alert Price |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| $100 | +10% | $100 x 1.10 | $110 |
| $100 | -15% | $100 x 0.85 | $85 |
| $50 | +20% | $50 x 1.20 | $60 |
| $200 | -5% | $200 x 0.95 | $190 |

### Using Technical Levels

Ask the AI for key technical levels to set meaningful alerts:

> "What are the key support and resistance levels for AAPL?"

The AI might identify:
- Support at $175 and $165
- Resistance at $195 and $210

Set your alerts based on these levels rather than arbitrary numbers.

### Round Number Psychology

Many traders watch round numbers ($50, $100, $200), creating natural support and resistance. Consider:

- **Alerts slightly above round numbers** for breakout confirmation
- **Alerts slightly below round numbers** for breakdown confirmation

**Example:** Instead of alert at exactly $100, set at $102 for above or $98 for below.

## Alert Behavior Details

### When Alerts Trigger

Alerts monitor during **regular market hours only**:
- 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time
- Monday through Friday
- Excluding market holidays

Pre-market and after-hours price movements do not trigger alerts.

### Price Matching

- **Price Above:** Triggers when price is **greater than or equal to** your target
- **Price Below:** Triggers when price is **less than or equal to** your target

The alert triggers on the first qualifying price during market hours.

### One-Time Alerts

After an alert triggers, it becomes inactive. It won't trigger again if the price crosses your level multiple times.

**To keep monitoring:**
- Create a new alert at the same or different level
- Set up a ladder of alerts at different prices

### Stock Splits and Alerts

If a stock splits, your alert price automatically adjusts.

**Example:** You have an alert for AAPL at $200. If Apple does a 2-for-1 split, your alert adjusts to $100 to maintain the equivalent level.

## Alert Limits

| Plan | Total Alerts |
|------|--------------|
| Free | Up to 5 active alerts |
| Pro | Unlimited alerts |

Free users need to be selective. Pro users can create comprehensive alert networks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I set percentage-based alerts?

Currently, alerts are price-based only. Calculate the target price using the percentage you want and set the alert at that level.

### Do alerts work for ETFs?

Yes, you can set alerts for any security we track, including ETFs, not just individual stocks.

### How many alerts can I set per stock?

As many as you want (within your total alert limit). Multiple alerts on the same stock is a common and useful strategy.

### What happens if price gaps past my alert level?

The alert still triggers. If you set an alert at $100 and the stock gaps from $95 to $105, your alert triggers at the open.

### Can I set alerts without adding stocks to a watchlist?

Yes, you can set alerts for any stock whether or not it's in one of your watchlists.

### Do alerts trigger on after-hours prices?

No. Alerts only monitor during regular market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday).
