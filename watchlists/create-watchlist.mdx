# Creating Your First Watchlist

Watchlists let you track stocks you're interested in without owning them. Keep an eye on potential investments, monitor competitors, or organize your research—all in one place.

## Create a Watchlist on Web

1. **Click "Watchlists"** in the left sidebar

2. **Click "+ New Watchlist"** (or "Create Watchlist" if this is your first)

3. **Name your watchlist**
   - Choose something descriptive: "Tech Stocks to Research," "Dividend Ideas," "Competitors"
   - You can rename it later if needed

4. **Click "Create"**

Your empty watchlist is ready. Now let's add some stocks.

## Add Stocks to Your Watchlist

### Method 1: From the Watchlist Page

1. Open your watchlist
2. Click **"+ Add Stock"** or the search icon
3. Type a ticker symbol (like AAPL) or company name (like Apple)
4. Click the stock from the dropdown results
5. It's added instantly

### Method 2: From Any Stock Page

1. Navigate to any stock page (search for it or click from anywhere)
2. Click the **"+ Watchlist"** button (or bookmark icon)
3. Select which watchlist to add it to
4. Done!

### Method 3: From Search Results

1. Use the main search bar to find a stock
2. Hover over the result
3. Click the **"+"** icon to add directly to a watchlist
4. Choose your watchlist

### Method 4: Ask the AI

You can even use the AI to build watchlists:
> "Add AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL to my Tech watchlist"

The AI will add them for you (if you have a watchlist with that name).

## What You'll See in Your Watchlist

Once you've added stocks, your watchlist shows:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Symbol** | Ticker symbol (AAPL, TSLA, etc.) |
| **Name** | Company name |
| **Price** | Current price (real-time for Pro, 15-min delayed for Free) |
| **Change** | Today's price change ($ and %) |
| **Market Cap** | Total company value |
| **52W Range** | Where current price sits in the yearly range |

You can customize columns based on what matters most to you.

## Organize with Multiple Watchlists

Create separate watchlists for different purposes:

- **"Research Queue"** - Stocks you want to dig into
- **"Dividend Stocks"** - Income-focused investments
- **"Tech Sector"** - Industry-specific tracking
- **"Earnings This Week"** - Timely monitoring
- **"Competitors"** - Companies in your industry

**Free tier:** Up to 3 watchlists
**Pro tier:** Unlimited watchlists

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many stocks can I add to one watchlist?

There's no limit on stocks per watchlist. Add as many as you want.

### Can I add the same stock to multiple watchlists?

Yes! A stock can be in as many watchlists as you like. Adding AAPL to "Tech Stocks" doesn't prevent you from also adding it to "Dividend Payers."

### Do watchlists sync between web and mobile?

Yes, your watchlists sync across all devices. Create one on web, and it appears on your phone instantly.

### Can I share a watchlist with someone?

Currently, watchlists are private to your account. Sharing features may be added in the future. [Request this feature →](/support/feedback)

### What's the difference between a watchlist and a portfolio?

- **Watchlist:** Stocks you're tracking/researching (you may not own them)
- **Portfolio:** Stocks you actually own, with quantities and cost basis

You can track the same stocks in both, but portfolios include ownership details for performance tracking.
