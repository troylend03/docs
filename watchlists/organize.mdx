# Organizing Multiple Watchlists

As you track more stocks, a single watchlist becomes cluttered and hard to use. Creating multiple themed watchlists helps you stay organized, focused, and efficient in your research.

## Why Use Multiple Watchlists?

A single "everything" watchlist creates problems:

- **Information overload** — 50+ stocks becomes overwhelming
- **Lost context** — Why did you add that stock again?
- **Missed opportunities** — Important stocks get buried
- **Slower research** — Finding what you need takes longer

Multiple focused watchlists solve these issues by giving each group of stocks a clear purpose.

## Watchlist Limits by Plan

| Plan | Watchlist Limit |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | Up to 3 watchlists |
| Pro | Unlimited watchlists |

Even with just 3 watchlists, you can organize effectively. With Pro, you can create as many as you need.

## Naming Your Watchlists

Good names make watchlists useful. Bad names create confusion.

### Effective Naming Strategies

**Be specific about purpose:**
- "Earnings This Week" — Clear timeframe and focus
- "Dividend Growth Candidates" — Specific investment thesis
- "AI Sector Deep Dive" — Research-focused with clear topic

**Avoid generic names:**
- "Watchlist 1" — Meaningless
- "Stocks" — Too broad
- "Stuff" — You'll forget why things are there

**Include timeframes when relevant:**
- "Q1 2024 Earnings Plays"
- "Hold Until Rate Cut"
- "Check After ER"

**Use action-oriented names:**
- "Ready to Buy" — Stocks you've researched and are waiting for entry
- "Sell Targets" — Holdings you're looking to exit
- "Research Queue" — Stocks waiting for deeper analysis

## Organizing by Investment Style

Create watchlists that match how you invest.

### Growth Investor Setup

| Watchlist | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| "High Growth Tech" | Fast-growing technology stocks |
| "Emerging Leaders" | Smaller companies with big potential |
| "Growth at Risk" | Positions to watch closely |
| "IPO Watch" | Recent IPOs to evaluate |

### Value Investor Setup

| Watchlist | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| "Deep Value" | Significantly undervalued companies |
| "Quality at Fair Price" | Great companies at reasonable valuations |
| "Turnaround Plays" | Companies in recovery |
| "Dividend Aristocrats" | Consistent dividend growers |

### Active Trader Setup

| Watchlist | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| "In Play Today" | Stocks with catalysts today |
| "Breakout Watch" | Near technical breakout levels |
| "Support Levels" | Watching for bounces |
| "Earnings Movers" | Pre/post earnings volatility plays |

## Organizing by Research Stage

Track stocks through your research process.

### The Research Pipeline

**Stage 1: "Idea Inbox"**
- Stocks you heard about but haven't researched
- Tips from friends, articles, podcasts
- Let ideas accumulate here

**Stage 2: "Research Queue"**
- Moved from Idea Inbox after initial interest
- Stocks you've committed to analyzing
- Work through this list systematically

**Stage 3: "Under Analysis"**
- Currently researching these stocks
- Keep this list small (5-10 max)
- Deep dive in progress

**Stage 4: "Ready to Buy"**
- Research complete, thesis validated
- Waiting for right entry price
- Set price alerts for these

**Stage 5: "Passed" or "Not Now"**
- Researched but decided against
- Keep for future reference
- Note why you passed (use AI for context)

## Organizing by Sector or Theme

Group related stocks together for comparison.

### Sector-Based Watchlists

- "Tech Giants" — AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META
- "Banking Sector" — JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, C
- "Healthcare" — JNJ, UNH, PFE, ABBV, MRK
- "Energy" — XOM, CVX, COP, SLB, EOG

### Theme-Based Watchlists

- "AI & Machine Learning" — Companies benefiting from AI trend
- "Clean Energy" — Renewable energy plays
- "Consumer Staples" — Recession-resistant businesses
- "Cybersecurity" — Digital security companies

### Why Sector Organization Works

When you group competitors together, you can:
- Compare valuations across similar companies
- Spot sector-wide trends quickly
- Identify relative strength/weakness
- Make better "best in class" decisions

## Practical Workflows

### The Weekly Review Workflow

**Sunday evening (15 minutes):**

1. Review "Earnings This Week" watchlist
2. Check "Ready to Buy" for any near price targets
3. Clean up "Idea Inbox" — move promising stocks to "Research Queue"
4. Archive or delete stale entries

### The Daily Check Workflow

**Morning (5 minutes):**

1. Check "Core Positions" for overnight moves
2. Glance at "Ready to Buy" for opportunities
3. Review any triggered price alerts

### The Research Day Workflow

**When you have time for deeper work:**

1. Pick a stock from "Research Queue"
2. Ask the AI for a comprehensive analysis
3. Move to "Ready to Buy" or "Passed" based on findings
4. Set price alerts if buying

## Managing Watchlist Size

### Recommended Limits

| Watchlist Type | Suggested Max |
|----------------|---------------|
| Active trading | 10-15 stocks |
| Sector tracking | 15-20 stocks |
| Research queue | 20-25 stocks |
| Idea inbox | 50 stocks (clean regularly) |

### When to Remove Stocks

Remove a stock when:
- Your thesis has played out (bought or passed)
- The company fundamentally changed
- You haven't thought about it in months
- It no longer fits the watchlist's purpose

### Monthly Cleanup Routine

Set a monthly reminder to:

1. Review each watchlist
2. Remove stocks you've lost interest in
3. Consolidate overlapping watchlists
4. Archive completed research

## Duplicating Stocks Across Watchlists

You can add the same stock to multiple watchlists. This is useful for:

**Cross-referencing:**
- AAPL in "Tech Sector" AND "Dividend Growth"
- NVDA in "AI Theme" AND "Under Analysis"

**Different contexts:**
- "What I Own" (tracking current holdings)
- "Tech Sector" (comparing to competitors)

**Time-based views:**
- "Q1 Earnings" (temporary)
- "Core Holdings" (permanent)

## Using the AI to Manage Watchlists

The AI assistant can help you organize.

### Ask for suggestions:
> "What sectors should I create watchlists for given my interest in dividend investing?"

### Get categorization help:
> "Which of my watchlist stocks are in the technology sector?"

### Automate additions:
> "Add all the major semiconductor companies to my Chip Stocks watchlist"

### Research across lists:
> "Compare the valuations of stocks in my Tech Sector watchlist"

## Watchlist Organization for Free Users

With only 3 watchlists, you need to be strategic.

### Recommended 3-Watchlist Setup

1. **"Tracking"** — Stocks you're actively monitoring
2. **"Research"** — Stocks you're currently analyzing
3. **"Ready"** — Stocks you've researched and want to buy

### Rotating Strategy

Since you're limited, rotate watchlists by focus:
- Delete "Earnings Week" after earnings pass
- Create "Sector Focus: [X]" for deep dives
- Archive by moving key stocks to another list before deleting

### When to Upgrade

Consider [upgrading to Pro](/billing/upgrade) when:
- You're constantly hitting the 3-watchlist limit
- You want permanent sector or theme watchlists
- Your research process needs more stages
- You track many stocks across different strategies
