# Setting Up Price Alerts

Price alerts notify you when a stock hits a price you care about. Whether you're waiting to buy at a lower price or watching for a breakout, alerts help you stay on top of the market without constantly checking.

## How Price Alerts Work

1. **You set a target** — Choose a stock and specify a price
2. **We monitor** — Our system watches the stock in real-time
3. **Price is reached** — The stock hits your target
4. **You're notified** — Get an email, push notification, or both

Alerts trigger during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday). After-hours and pre-market movements are not tracked for alerts.

## Alert Types

### Price Above

Triggers when the stock price rises **to or above** your target.

**Use for:**
- Breakout alerts (notify me if it breaks resistance)
- Sell targets (remind me when it hits my goal)
- Momentum signals (alert if it starts running)

**Example:** Set alert for AAPL above $200 → You're notified when AAPL reaches $200 or higher.

### Price Below

Triggers when the stock price falls **to or below** your target.

**Use for:**
- Buy opportunities (notify me when it's cheap enough)
- Stop-loss reminders (alert if it drops to danger zone)
- Support breaks (notify if it falls through support)

**Example:** Set alert for TSLA below $150 → You're notified when TSLA drops to $150 or lower.

## Notification Options

Choose how you want to be notified when alerts trigger:

### Email Notifications

Receive an email when your alert triggers. Good for non-urgent alerts.

**Enable:** Settings → Notifications → Price Alerts → Email ✓

### Push Notifications

Get instant notifications on your phone. Best for time-sensitive alerts.

**Enable:**
1. Make sure the Rallies app is installed
2. Allow notifications in your phone settings
3. Settings → Notifications → Price Alerts → Push ✓

### In-App Notifications

See triggered alerts in your Rallies notification center.

**Enable:** Settings → Notifications → Price Alerts → In-App ✓

> 💡 **Tip:** For important price targets, enable both email AND push so you don't miss it.

## What Happens After an Alert Triggers

When your alert is triggered:

1. **You receive notifications** based on your settings
2. **The alert is marked as triggered** in your alerts list
3. **The alert becomes inactive** — It won't trigger again

Alerts are one-time by default. If you want ongoing monitoring:
- Create a new alert after one triggers
- Or set multiple alerts at different price levels

## Tips for Effective Alerts

### Set Realistic Targets

Don't set alerts at prices far from the current price unless you have a long timeframe. An alert for a stock to drop 50% might never trigger.

### Use Round Numbers Wisely

Many traders watch round numbers ($100, $50, etc.), so prices often pause or react at these levels. Consider setting alerts slightly above/below round numbers.

### Combine with Research

Before setting an alert, ask the AI about key support/resistance levels:
> "What are the key technical levels for AAPL?"

Set alerts at meaningful price points, not arbitrary numbers.

### Layer Your Alerts (Pro)

With unlimited alerts, you can set multiple levels:
- Alert at $95 (first buy zone)
- Alert at $90 (stronger buy)
- Alert at $85 (back up the truck)

### Don't Forget About Them

Review your alerts periodically. Old alerts for prices that no longer make sense should be deleted or updated.

## Troubleshooting

### Alert didn't trigger even though price hit my target

**Possible reasons:**
- Price hit target outside market hours (alerts only track regular hours)
- The price touched your target but you had email/push disabled
- Brief price spike that was too fast (rare)

**Check:**
- Your notification settings (Settings → Notifications)
- The stock's intraday chart to see if price actually reached target during market hours

### I'm not receiving alert notifications

1. Check Settings → Notifications → Price Alerts are enabled
2. For push: Verify app has notification permission in phone settings
3. For email: Check spam folder, add alerts@rallies.ai to contacts
4. [Full notification troubleshooting →](/troubleshooting/not-receiving-emails)

### I hit my alert limit

Free users are limited to 5 alerts. Options:
- Delete alerts you no longer need
- [Upgrade to Pro](/billing/upgrade) for unlimited alerts

### Can I set alerts for stocks not in my watchlist?

Yes! You can set alerts for any stock. It doesn't need to be in a watchlist.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do alerts work on weekends?

Alerts only monitor during regular market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday). Weekend price changes (rare, but can happen with some securities) aren't tracked.

### Can I set percentage-based alerts?

Currently, alerts are price-based only. For a percentage move, calculate the target price and set the alert at that level.

### Do alerts account for stock splits?

Yes. If a stock splits, your alert price will adjust automatically to remain at the equivalent level.

### Can I set alerts for ETFs, not just stocks?

Yes, alerts work for any security we track, including ETFs.

### How fast do alerts trigger?

Alerts typically trigger within seconds of the price being reached during market hours. Push notifications arrive almost instantly; email may take 1-2 minutes.
