# Watchlist Tips & Best Practices

Watchlists are simple to create but easy to neglect. These tips help you build watchlists that actually support better investment decisions.

## Getting Started Right

### Start Small, Expand Later

Resist the urge to add every stock you've ever heard of. Start with:

- 5-10 stocks you're genuinely interested in
- Companies you already understand
- Stocks you might actually buy

You can always add more. Starting small keeps your watchlist actionable.

### Have a Reason for Every Stock

Before adding a stock, ask yourself:

> "Why am I adding this? What would make me buy or sell it?"

If you can't answer, don't add it. Random additions create cluttered, useless watchlists.

### Create Themed Watchlists Early

Even with just a few stocks, organizing by theme saves time later:

| Watchlist | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| "Research Queue" | Stocks to investigate |
| "Ready to Buy" | Researched and waiting for entry |
| "Tracking" | Stocks you're monitoring long-term |

This creates a natural workflow from discovery to action.

## Daily Watchlist Habits

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

Build a quick morning check into your routine:

1. **Open your main watchlist** — Check overnight moves
2. **Scan for unusual activity** — Big gainers or losers
3. **Check triggered alerts** — Review any notifications
4. **Note anything to research later** — Don't get distracted now

Keep it short. You're checking in, not doing deep research.

### End-of-Day Review (5 minutes)

Before closing the app:

1. **Review today's movers** — Understand why stocks moved
2. **Update price alerts** — Adjust if targets were hit or missed
3. **Add new ideas** — Capture any stocks you heard about today
4. **Move stocks between lists** — Completed research? Move to "Ready to Buy"

### Weekly Deep Dive (30 minutes)

Once a week, spend more time:

1. **Review each watchlist** — Is it still relevant?
2. **Clean up stale entries** — Remove stocks you've lost interest in
3. **Research 2-3 stocks deeply** — Use the AI for comprehensive analysis
4. **Update your buy targets** — Adjust based on new information
5. **Check your alert setup** — Are important stocks covered?

## Organization Best Practices

### Use Descriptive Names

Good watchlist names tell you exactly what's inside:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Watchlist 1" | "Tech Sector Watch" |
| "Stocks" | "Dividend Growth Candidates" |
| "New" | "Ideas to Research" |
| "Good ones" | "Ready to Buy at Pullback" |

### Keep "Active" Lists Small

Your most-checked watchlist should be lean:

- **10-15 stocks maximum** for daily tracking
- Any more becomes overwhelming
- Move inactive ideas to a separate list

### Create an "Archive" Watchlist

Instead of deleting stocks you're done with:

1. Create an "Archive" or "Passed On" watchlist
2. Move completed research there
3. Note why you passed (use AI to remind yourself later)
4. Review occasionally — your opinion might change

### Review and Rotate

Watchlists aren't permanent. Every few months:

- Delete watchlists you never check
- Merge overlapping lists
- Rename unclear watchlists
- Create new ones for new interests

## Power User Techniques

### The "Buy Zone" System

For each stock you want to buy, identify your ideal entry price range:

1. Research fair value (ask the AI for help)
2. Set a "Good Entry" price (small discount to fair value)
3. Set a "Great Entry" price (larger discount)
4. Set a "Back Up the Truck" price (significant discount)

Create price alerts at each level. When alerts trigger, you know exactly how attractive the opportunity is.

**Example for AAPL:**

| Level | Price | Alert Set? |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Good Entry | $175 | Yes |
| Great Entry | $160 | Yes |
| Back Up the Truck | $145 | Yes |

### The Earnings Calendar Workflow

Before earnings season:

1. Create a temporary "Earnings This Week" watchlist
2. Add companies reporting in the coming days
3. Set alerts for ±10% moves (catch big reactions)
4. After earnings, move stocks back to regular watchlists
5. Delete the temporary list and recreate for next week

### Competitive Analysis Watchlists

For any industry you're invested in, track the competition:

1. Create a sector-specific watchlist (e.g., "Cloud Computing")
2. Add the major players: AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, CRM, SNOW
3. Compare valuations and performance side-by-side
4. Identify which company deserves your investment

Ask the AI:
> "Compare the cloud computing companies in my watchlist. Which has the best growth prospects?"

### The "What I Sold" List

Track stocks you've exited:

1. Create a "Former Holdings" watchlist
2. Add stocks when you sell them
3. Set alerts at your previous buy levels
4. Learn from watching what happens after you sell

This helps you:
- Avoid regret (or confirm good decisions)
- Identify re-entry opportunities
- Improve your selling discipline

## Using the AI with Watchlists

### Get Instant Analysis

From any watchlist, you can quickly ask the AI about any stock:

> "Give me a quick overview of NVDA"

> "What's the bull and bear case for TSLA?"

> "Should I be worried about AAPL's recent drop?"

### Compare Stocks

Ask the AI to compare multiple watchlist stocks:

> "Compare MSFT and GOOGL for someone looking for a long-term tech hold"

> "Which stock in my Tech watchlist has the best valuation?"

### Get Research Suggestions

> "What should I research about AMZN before buying?"

> "What are the key risks for the stocks in my Dividend watchlist?"

### Build Watchlists with AI Help

> "What are the top 10 dividend aristocrats? Add them to my Dividend watchlist"

> "What semiconductor stocks should I be watching?"

## Mobile Watchlist Tips

### Enable Push Notifications

For important price alerts:

1. Make sure the Rallies app has notification permissions
2. Enable push notifications in Settings > Notifications
3. Your phone becomes a real-time alert system

### Use the Widget (iOS)

If available, add the Rallies widget to your home screen:

- Quick glance at watchlist performance
- See key movers without opening the app
- Save time on daily checks

### Quick Add on Mobile

When you hear about a stock:

1. Open the app
2. Search for the stock
3. Tap "+ Watchlist" to add immediately
4. Research later

Capture ideas quickly; don't let them slip away.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Adding Everything

**The problem:** Your watchlist has 100+ stocks. You never look at most of them.

**The fix:** Be selective. Remove anything you haven't thought about in a month.

### Mistake 2: No Organization

**The problem:** One massive watchlist with no theme or purpose.

**The fix:** Create 3-5 focused watchlists. Move stocks to appropriate categories.

### Mistake 3: Set and Forget

**The problem:** You created a watchlist months ago and never updated it.

**The fix:** Schedule weekly reviews. Remove stale stocks, add new ideas.

### Mistake 4: No Price Alerts

**The problem:** You check your watchlist constantly, afraid of missing moves.

**The fix:** Set price alerts for important levels. Let the app watch for you.

### Mistake 5: Not Using the AI

**The problem:** You have stocks in your watchlist but never research them deeply.

**The fix:** Work through your "Research Queue" using the AI. Move stocks to "Ready to Buy" or "Passed" based on findings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I review my watchlists?

Daily quick checks (5 minutes), weekly deeper reviews (30 minutes), and monthly maintenance (15 minutes). The exact time depends on how actively you invest.

### What's the ideal watchlist size?

For daily monitoring, 10-15 stocks. For research queues, up to 25. For sector tracking, 15-20. Avoid watchlists over 50 stocks.

### Should I keep stocks I've decided not to buy?

Consider creating an "Archive" or "Passed" watchlist. This preserves your research without cluttering active lists.

### Can I use watchlists to track my portfolio?

You can, but portfolios (with cost basis and share counts) are better for tracking what you own. Watchlists are best for stocks you're watching but don't own.

### How do I remember why I added a stock?

Use descriptive watchlist names. You can also ask the AI: "Why might someone be interested in [stock]?" to refresh your memory.
