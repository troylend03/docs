# Why Didn't I Get My Alert?

You set a price alert, the stock hit your target, but you never got notified. Frustrating. Let's figure out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

Before diving deep, check these common issues:

- [ ] Did the price hit your target during **regular market hours**?
- [ ] Are your **notification settings** enabled for price alerts?
- [ ] Check your **spam/junk folder** for email alerts
- [ ] Is the Rallies app allowed to send **push notifications** on your phone?
- [ ] Did the alert **already trigger** previously?

If you checked all these and still can't find the issue, keep reading.

## Reason 1: Price Hit Outside Market Hours

**The most common reason alerts don't trigger.**

### How It Works

Alerts only monitor during regular market hours:
- **9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time**
- **Monday through Friday**
- **Excluding market holidays**

Pre-market (4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET) and after-hours (4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET) trading does not trigger alerts.

### Example

You set an alert for AAPL at $200. After the market closes at 4:00 PM ET, Apple announces news and the stock moves in after-hours trading:

| Time | Price | Alert Status |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 4:01 PM | $198 | No monitoring |
| 5:30 PM | $203 | No monitoring |
| 6:00 PM | $205 | No monitoring |
| 9:30 AM (next day) | $202 | Alert triggers at open |

If the stock touched $200 only during after-hours and opened above it, your alert would trigger at the open price, not at exactly $200.

### What to Do

- **Understand the limitation:** Alerts are designed for regular trading hours
- **Check after-hours activity:** If you suspect after-hours movement, check the extended hours chart
- **Adjust your target:** If catching after-hours moves matters, set a tighter target that might trigger during regular hours first

## Reason 2: Notification Settings Are Off

Your alert triggered, but you weren't notified because notifications are disabled.

### Check Your Settings

1. Go to **Settings** in Rallies
2. Navigate to **Notifications**
3. Find **Price Alerts** section
4. Make sure at least one notification method is enabled:
   - Email
   - Push
   - In-App

### What You Might Find

| Setting | Status | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Email alerts | Off | No email notifications |
| Push alerts | Off | No phone notifications |
| All alerts | Off | No notifications at all |

**Fix:** Toggle on the notification types you want.

### Verify Your Alert Triggered

Even without notifications, you can check if an alert triggered:

1. Go to **Alerts** in the app
2. Look for your alert in the **"Triggered"** or **"History"** section
3. If it's there, the alert worked—you just weren't notified

## Reason 3: Push Notifications Are Blocked

Your phone might be blocking Rallies from sending push notifications.

### Check iOS Settings

1. Open your iPhone **Settings**
2. Scroll down and tap **Rallies**
3. Tap **Notifications**
4. Make sure **Allow Notifications** is ON
5. Enable **Lock Screen**, **Notification Center**, and **Banners**

### Check Android Settings

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Apps** or **Applications**
3. Find **Rallies**
4. Tap **Notifications**
5. Make sure notifications are **Enabled**
6. Check that the app isn't in "Do Not Disturb" exceptions

### Other Phone Settings That Block Notifications

- **Focus Mode / Do Not Disturb:** Rallies might be silenced
- **Battery Saver:** May prevent background notifications
- **Data Saver:** May block push notifications on mobile data
- **App hibernation:** Unused apps might be put to sleep

### Test Push Notifications

To verify push notifications work:

1. Go to Settings > Notifications in Rallies
2. Look for a **"Send Test Notification"** option
3. Tap it and see if you receive a notification

If the test fails, there's a device or permission issue to fix.

## Reason 4: Email Went to Spam

Email alerts might be delivered but filtered into spam or promotional folders.

### Check These Folders

**Gmail users:**
- Spam
- Promotions tab
- Updates tab
- Search: `from:rallies.ai`

**Outlook users:**
- Junk Email
- "Other" inbox (if using Focused Inbox)

**Yahoo users:**
- Spam
- Bulk Mail

### Whitelist Rallies Emails

Add these addresses to your contacts to prevent filtering:

- alerts@rallies.ai
- hello@rallies.ai
- noreply@rallies.ai

## Reason 5: The Alert Already Triggered

Alerts are **one-time only**. After triggering once, they become inactive.

### How to Check

1. Go to **Alerts** in Rallies
2. Look at alert status:
   - **Active:** Waiting to trigger
   - **Triggered:** Already fired, now inactive
   - **Paused:** Manually disabled

### What Happened

If you set an alert at $100 and the stock hit $100 last week, the alert triggered then. When the stock hits $100 again, there's no active alert anymore.

### The Fix

To monitor the same level again:
1. Delete the old triggered alert (optional)
2. Create a new alert at the same price
3. The new alert will watch for the next time the price is reached

### Pro Tip: Set Multiple Alerts

If you want ongoing monitoring at certain levels, set multiple alerts at different prices. When one triggers, you can recreate it while others remain active.

## Reason 6: Price Touched Briefly

Sometimes a stock briefly touches a price and reverses quickly.

### How Alerts Handle This

- Alerts check price throughout the trading day
- Most brief touches should trigger alerts
- Extremely fast spikes (lasting milliseconds) might occasionally be missed

### What You Can Do

- **Check the intraday chart:** Use 1-minute candles to see if the price actually reached your target during market hours
- **Set alerts with a small buffer:** If your target is $100, set at $99.50 to catch near-misses
- **Verify the high/low of the day:** Compare against your alert price

### Understanding Price Data

Your alert uses the stock's trading price. Sometimes what you see on a chart might differ slightly from when data was recorded. Check multiple sources if you're confident the price was reached.

## Reason 7: Alert Was Paused or Deleted

You might have accidentally paused or deleted the alert.

### Check Your Alert List

1. Go to **Alerts**
2. Look for your alert
3. Check if it's toggled off (paused)
4. Check if it exists at all

### What Might Have Happened

- You paused the alert and forgot to re-enable it
- You deleted it thinking you didn't need it anymore
- You hit your alert limit and couldn't create it

### The Fix

If the alert is paused, toggle it back on. If it's missing, recreate it.

## Reason 8: Alert Limit Reached

Free users are limited to 5 active alerts.

### What Happens

- If you have 5 alerts and try to create a 6th, you'll get an error
- You might have thought you created an alert, but it wasn't saved

### Check Your Alert Count

1. Go to **Alerts**
2. Count your active alerts
3. If you have 5 (on Free), you're at the limit

### Solutions

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Free up space | Delete alerts you no longer need |
| Prioritize | Keep only your most important alerts |
| Upgrade | [Get Pro](/billing/upgrade) for unlimited alerts |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do alerts work on weekends?

No. Alerts only monitor during regular market hours (Monday-Friday, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET). Weekend price changes (rare, but can happen) aren't tracked.

### Can after-hours trading trigger my alert?

No. Pre-market and after-hours trading do not trigger alerts. Only regular market hours are monitored.

### How quickly should alerts notify me?

Push notifications arrive within seconds. Email may take 1-2 minutes. If you're waiting more than 5 minutes during market hours, something may be wrong.

### Why did I get an alert but the stock never hit my price?

This is rare. It could be a brief spike that reversed before you checked, or a data discrepancy. Check the intraday chart with 1-minute candles to verify.

### Can I set alerts to trigger multiple times?

Alerts are one-time by default. After triggering, you need to create a new alert to monitor the same level again.

### What happens if I'm offline when my alert triggers?

Push notifications wait for your device to connect. Email is sent regardless. When you come back online, you should receive any pending notifications.
